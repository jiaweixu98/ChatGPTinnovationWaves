However, due to the sheer amount of model parameters, the inference speed of these models is very slow. How to apply these complex models to real business scenarios becomes a challenging but practical problem. Previous works often leverage model compression approaches to resolve this problem. However, these methods usually induce information loss during the model compression procedure, leading to incomparable results between compressed model and the original model. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Multi-task Knowledge Distillation Model (MKDM for short) for web-scale Question Answering system, by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models to a light-weight student model. In this way, more generalized knowledge can be transferred. The experiment results show that our method can significantly outperform the baseline methods and even achieve comparable results with the original teacher models, along with significant speedup of model inference.

However, this framework still has some fundamental problems in effectively incorporating supervised knowledge from other related tasks. In this study, we investigate a transferable BERT (TransBERT) training framework, which can transfer not only general language knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data but also specific kinds of knowledge from various semantically related supervised tasks, for a target task. Particularly, we propose utilizing three kinds of transfer tasks, including natural language inference, sentiment classification, and next action prediction, to further train BERT based on a pre-trained model. This enables the model to get a better initialization for the target task. We take story ending prediction as the target task to conduct experiments. The final result, an accuracy of 91.8%, dramatically outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline methods. Several comparative experiments give some helpful suggestions on how to select transfer tasks. Error analysis shows what are the strength and weakness of BERT-based models for story ending prediction.

A trained and well-behaved model can be fooled by a visually imperceptible perturbation, i.e., an originally correctly classified image could be misclassified after a slight perturbation. In this paper, we propose a black-box strategy to attack such networks using an evolution algorithm. First, we formalize the generation of an adversarial example into the optimization problem of perturbations that represent the noise added to an original image at each pixel. To solve this optimization problem in a black-box way, we find that an evolution algorithm perfectly meets our requirement since it can work without any gradient information. Therefore, we test various evolution algorithms, including a simple genetic algorithm, a parameter-exploring policy gradient, an OpenAI evolution strategy, and a covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy. Experimental results show that a covariance matrix adaptive evolution Strategy performs best in this optimization problem. Additionally, we also perform several experiments to explore the effect of different regularizations on improving the quality of an adversarial example.

In this work, we introduce a concerted training framework (CTNMT) that is the key to integrate the pre-trained LMs to neural machine translation (NMT). Our proposed CTNMT consists of three techniques: a) asymptotic distillation to ensure that the NMT model can retain the previous pre-trained knowledge; b) a dynamic switching gate to avoid catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge; and c) a strategy to adjust the learning paces according to a scheduled policy. Our experiments in machine translation show CTNMT gains of up to 3 BLEU score on the WMT14 English-German language pair which even surpasses the previous state-of-the-art pre-training aided NMT by 1.4 BLEU score. While for the large WMT14 English-French task with 40 millions of sentence-pairs, our base model still significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art Transformer big model by more than 1 BLEU score.

Unlike encoder-only (e.g., BERT) or decoder-only (e.g., OpenAI GPT) pre-training approaches, PoDA jointly pre-trains both the encoder and decoder by denoising the noise-corrupted text, and it also has the advantage of keeping the network architecture unchanged in the subsequent fine-tuning stage. Meanwhile, we design a hybrid model of Transformer and pointer-generator networks as the backbone architecture for PoDA. We conduct experiments on two text generation tasks: abstractive summarization, and grammatical error correction. Results on four datasets show that PoDA can improve model performance over strong baselines without using any task-specific techniques and significantly speed up convergence.

However, the existing language representation models including ELMo, GPT and BERT only exploit plain context-sensitive features such as character or word embeddings. They rarely consider incorporating structured semantic information which can provide rich semantics for language representation. To promote natural language understanding, we propose to incorporate explicit contextual semantics from pre-trained semantic role labeling, and introduce an improved language representation model, Semantics-aware BERT (SemBERT), which is capable of explicitly absorbing contextual semantics over a BERT backbone. SemBERT keeps the convenient usability of its BERT precursor in a light fine-tuning way without substantial task-specific modifications.

However, how much pre-trained language models can help dialog response generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose a simple, general, and effective framework: Alternating Roles Dialog Model (ARDM). ARDM models each speaker separately and takes advantage of the large pre-trained language model. It requires no supervision from human annotations such as belief states or dialog acts to achieve effective conversations. ARDM outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods on two popular task-oriented dialog datasets: CamRest676 and MultiWOZ.

Round-trip translation, also known as the pivoting method, is a typical approach to this end. However, we notice that the pivoting process involves multiple machine translation models and is likely to incur semantic drift during the two-step translations. In this paper, inspired by the Transformer-based language models, we propose a simple and unified paraphrasing model, which is purely trained on multilingual parallel data and can conduct zero-shot paraphrase generation in one step. Compared with the pivoting approach, paraphrases generated by our model is more semantically similar to the input sentence. Moreover, since our model shares the same architecture as GPT (Radford et al., 2018), we are able to pre-train the model on large-scale unparallel corpus, which further improves the fluency of the output sentences. In addition, we introduce the mechanism of denoising auto-encoder (DAE) to improve diversity and robustness of the model. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the pivoting method in terms of relevance, diversity, fluency and efficiency.

There have been works showing that syntactic, semantic and word sense knowledge are contained in such representations, which explains why they benefit such tasks. However, relatively little work has been done investigating commonsense knowledge contained in contextualized representations, which is crucial for human question answering and reading comprehension. We study the commonsense ability of GPT, BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by testing them on seven challenging benchmarks, finding that language modeling and its variants are effective objectives for promoting models' commonsense ability while bi-directional context and larger training set are bonuses. We additionally find that current models do poorly on tasks require more necessary inference steps. Finally, we test the robustness of models by making dual test cases, which are correlated so that the correct prediction of one sample should lead to correct prediction of the other. Interestingly, the models show confusion on these test cases, which suggests that they learn commonsense at the surface rather than the deep level. We release a test set, named CATs publicly, for future research.

However, using a technique named ""surgery"" OpenAI Five was continuously trained to play the game DotA 2 over the course of 10 months through 20 major changes in features and architecture. Surgery transfers trained weights from one network to another after a selection process to determine which sections of the model are unchanged and which must be re-initialized. In the past, the selection process relied on heuristics, manual labor, or pre-existing boundaries in the structure of the model, limiting the ability to salvage experiments after modifications of the feature set or input reorderings.   We propose a solution to automatically determine which components of a neural network model should be salvaged and which require retraining. We achieve this by allowing the model to operate over discrete sets of features and use set-based operations to determine the exact relationship between inputs and outputs, and how they change across tweaks in model architecture. In this paper, we introduce the methodology for enabling neural networks to operate on sets, derive two methods for detecting feature-parameter interaction maps, and show their equivalence. We empirically validate that we can surgery weights across feature and architecture changes to the OpenAI Five model.

AlphaStar and OpenAI Five have shown that agents can be trained without any explicit hierarchical macro-actions to reach superhuman skill in games that require taking thousands of actions before reaching the final goal. Assessing the agent's plans and game understanding becomes challenging given the lack of hierarchy or explicit representations of macro-actions in these models, coupled with the incomprehensible nature of the internal representations.   In this paper, we study the distributed representations learned by OpenAI Five to investigate how game knowledge is gradually obtained over the course of training. We also introduce a general technique for learning a model from the agent's hidden states to identify the formation of plans and subgoals. We show that the agent can learn situational similarity across actions, and find evidence of planning towards accomplishing subgoals minutes before they are executed. We perform a qualitative analysis of these predictions during the games against the DotA 2 world champions OG in April 2019.

In spite of the success in modeling fluency and local coherence, existing neural language generation models (e.g., GPT-2) still suffer from repetition, logic conflicts, and lack of long-range coherence in generated stories. We conjecture that this is because of the difficulty of associating relevant commonsense knowledge, understanding the causal relationships, and planning entities and events with proper temporal order. In this paper, we devise a knowledge-enhanced pretraining model for commonsense story generation. We propose to utilize commonsense knowledge from external knowledge bases to generate reasonable stories. To further capture the causal and temporal dependencies between the sentences in a reasonable story, we employ multi-task learning which combines a discriminative objective to distinguish true and fake stories during fine-tuning. Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more reasonable stories than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in terms of logic and global coherence.

As one of the most valuable literary and cultural heritages of China, Chinese classical poetry is very familiar and loved by Chinese people from generation to generation. It has many particular characteristics in its language structure, ranging from form, sound to meaning, thus is regarded as an ideal testing task for text generation. In this paper, we propose a GPT-2 based uniformed framework for generating major types of Chinese classical poems. We define a unified format for formulating all types of training samples by integrating detailed form information, then present a simple form-stressed weighting method in GPT-2 to strengthen the control to the form of the generated poems, with special emphasis on those forms with longer body length. Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content, validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The model has been incorporated into Jiuge, the most influential Chinese classical poetry generation system developed by Tsinghua University (Guo et al., 2019).

  European Symposium on Security and Privacy",,,,cs.CR cs.CL cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new paradigm of building natural language processing (NLP) systems: general-purpose, pre-trained language models (LMs) are composed with simple downstream models and fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks. This paradigm shift significantly simplifies the system development cycles. However, as many LMs are provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security implications, which are largely unexplored.   To bridge this gap, this work studies the security threats posed by malicious LMs to NLP systems. Specifically, we present TROJAN-LM, a new class of trojaning attacks in which maliciously crafted LMs trigger host NLP systems to malfunction in a highly predictable manner. By empirically studying three state-of-the-art LMs (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet) in a range of security-critical NLP tasks (toxic comment detection, question answering, text completion) as well as user studies on crowdsourcing platforms, we demonstrate that TROJAN-LM possesses the following properties: (i) flexibility - the adversary is able to flexibly dene logical combinations (e.g., 'and', 'or', 'xor') of arbitrary words as triggers, (ii) efficacy - the host systems misbehave as desired by the adversary with high probability when trigger-embedded inputs are present, (iii) specificity - the trojan LMs function indistinguishably from their benign counterparts on clean inputs, and (iv) fluency - the trigger-embedded inputs appear as fluent natural language and highly relevant to their surrounding contexts. We provide analytical justification for the practicality of TROJAN-LM, and further discuss potential countermeasures and their challenges, which lead to several promising research directions.

A research challenge is to learn each module with the least amount of samples (i.e., few-shots) given the high cost related to the data collection. The most common and effective technique to solve this problem is transfer learning, where large language models, either pre-trained on text or task-specific data, are fine-tuned on the few samples. These methods require fine-tuning steps and a set of parameters for each task. Differently, language models, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), allow few-shot learning by priming the model with few examples. In this paper, we evaluate the priming few-shot ability of language models in the NLU, DST, DP and NLG tasks. Importantly, we highlight the current limitations of this approach, and we discuss the possible implication for future work.

These models have little or no control of the generated responses and miss two important features: continuous dialogue skills integration and seamlessly leveraging diverse knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose the Adapter-Bot, a dialogue model that uses a fixed backbone conversational model such as DialGPT (Zhang et al., 2019) and triggers on-demand dialogue skills (e.g., emphatic response, weather information, movie recommendation) via different adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019). Each adapter can be trained independently, thus allowing a continual integration of skills without retraining the entire model. Depending on the skills, the model is able to process multiple knowledge types, such as text, tables, and graphs, in a seamless manner. The dialogue skills can be triggered automatically via a dialogue manager, or manually, thus allowing high-level control of the generated responses. At the current stage, we have implemented 12 response styles (e.g., positive, negative etc.), 8 goal-oriented skills (e.g. weather information, movie recommendation, etc.), and personalized and emphatic responses. We evaluate our model using automatic evaluation by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art conversational models, and we have released an interactive system at adapter.bot.ust.hk.

This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning controller which dynamically interpolates a model-based linear controller and an arbitrary differentiable policy. The linear controller is designed based on local linearised model knowledge, and stabilises the system in a neighbourhood about an operating point. The coefficients of interpolation between the two controllers are determined by a scaled distance function measuring the distance between the current state and the operating point. The overall hybrid controller is proven to maintain the stability guarantee around the neighborhood of the operating point and still possess the universal function approximation property of the arbitrary non-linear policy. Learning has been done on both model-based (PILCO) and model-free (DDPG) frameworks. Simulation experiments performed in OpenAI gym demonstrate stability and robustness of the proposed hybrid controller. This paper thus introduces a principled method allowing for the direct importing of control methodology into reinforcement learning.

To address this problem, we propose a Multi-hop Reasoning Generation (MRG) approach that incorporates multi-hop reasoning over a knowledge graph to learn semantic dependencies among sentences. MRG consists of twoparts, a graph-based multi-hop reasoning module and a path-aware sentence realization module. The reasoning module is responsible for searching skeleton paths from a knowledge graph to imitate the imagination process in the human writing for semantic transfer. Based on the inferred paths, the sentence realization module then generates a complete sentence. Unlike previous black-box models, MRG explicitly infers the skeleton path, which provides explanatory views tounderstand how the proposed model works. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks, including story generation, review generation, and product description generation. Automatic and manual evaluation show that our proposed method can generate more informative and coherentlong text than strong baselines, such as pre-trained models(e.g. GPT-2) and knowledge-enhanced models.

However, Transformer and its existing variants may not be optimal in capturing token distances because the position or distance embeddings used by these methods usually cannot keep the precise information of real distances, which may not be beneficial for modeling the orders and relations of contexts. In this paper, we propose DA-Transformer, which is a distance-aware Transformer that can exploit the real distance. We propose to incorporate the real distances between tokens to re-scale the raw self-attention weights, which are computed by the relevance between attention query and key. Concretely, in different self-attention heads the relative distance between each pair of tokens is weighted by different learnable parameters, which control the different preferences on long- or short-term information of these heads. Since the raw weighted real distances may not be optimal for adjusting self-attention weights, we propose a learnable sigmoid function to map them into re-scaled coefficients that have proper ranges. We first clip the raw self-attention weights via the ReLU function to keep non-negativity and introduce sparsity, and then multiply them with the re-scaled coefficients to encode real distance information into self-attention. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that DA-Transformer can effectively improve the performance of many tasks and outperform the vanilla Transformer and its several variants.

Although sentence-level rewriting has been fairly well-studied, little work has addressed the challenge of rewriting an entire document coherently. In this work, we introduce the task of document-level targeted content transfer and address it in the recipe domain, with a recipe as the document and a dietary restriction (such as vegan or dairy-free) as the targeted constraint. We propose a novel model for this task based on the generative pre-trained language model (GPT-2) and train on a large number of roughly-aligned recipe pairs (https://github.com/microsoft/document-level-targeted-content-transfer).

2010.08822,Wei Wang,"Wei Wang, Piji Li, Hai-Tao Zheng",Consistency and Coherency Enhanced Story Generation,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Story generation is a challenging task, which demands to maintain consistency of the plots and characters throughout the story. Previous works have shown that GPT2, a large-scale language model, has achieved good performance on story generation. However, we observe that several serious issues still exist in the stories generated by GPT2 which can be categorized into two folds: consistency and coherency. In terms of consistency, on one hand, GPT2 cannot guarantee the consistency of the plots explicitly. On the other hand, the generated stories usually contain coreference errors. In terms of coherency, GPT2 does not take account of the discourse relations between sentences of stories directly. To enhance the consistency and coherency of the generated stories, we propose a two-stage generation framework, where the first stage is to organize the story outline which depicts the story plots and events, and the second stage is to expand the outline into a complete story. Therefore the plots consistency can be controlled and guaranteed explicitly. In addition, coreference supervision signals are incorporated to reduce coreference errors and improve the coreference consistency. Moreover, we design an auxiliary task of discourse relation modeling to improve the coherency of the generated stories. Experimental results on a story dataset show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

Popular KGs (e.g, Wikidata, NELL) are built in either a supervised or semi-supervised manner, requiring humans to create knowledge. Recent deep language models automatically acquire knowledge from large-scale corpora via pre-training. The stored knowledge has enabled the language models to improve downstream NLP tasks, e.g., answering questions, and writing code and articles. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to cast the knowledge contained within language models into KGs. We show that KGs are constructed with a single forward pass of the pre-trained language models (without fine-tuning) over the corpora. We demonstrate the quality of the constructed KGs by comparing to two KGs (Wikidata, TAC KBP) created by humans. Our KGs also provide open factual knowledge that is new in the existing KGs.

Code and Data: https://github.com/INK-USC/CALM/",,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Pre-trained language models (PTLM) have achieved impressive results in a range of natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) tasks. However, current pre-training objectives such as masked token prediction (for BERT-style PTLMs) and masked span infilling (for T5-style PTLMs) do not explicitly model the relational commonsense knowledge about everyday concepts, which is crucial to many downstream tasks that need common sense to understand or generate. To augment PTLMs with concept-centric commonsense knowledge, in this paper, we propose both generative and contrastive objectives for learning common sense from the text, and use them as intermediate self-supervised learning tasks for incrementally pre-training PTLMs (before task-specific fine-tuning on downstream datasets). Furthermore, we develop a joint pre-training framework to unify generative and contrastive objectives so that they can mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experimental results show that our method, concept-aware language model (CALM), can pack more commonsense knowledge into the parameters of a pre-trained text-to-text transformer without relying on external knowledge graphs, yielding better performance on both NLU and NLG tasks. We show that while only incrementally pre-trained on a relatively small corpus for a few steps, CALM outperforms baseline methods by a consistent margin and even comparable with some larger PTLMs, which suggests that CALM can serve as a general, plug-and-play method for improving the commonsense reasoning ability of a PTLM.

However, existing work falls short in handling the raw game complexity caused by the explosion of agent combinations, i.e., lineups, when expanding the hero pool in case that OpenAI's Dota AI limits the play to a pool of only 17 heroes. As a result, full MOBA games without restrictions are far from being mastered by any existing AI system. In this paper, we propose a MOBA AI learning paradigm that methodologically enables playing full MOBA games with deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we develop a combination of novel and existing learning techniques, including curriculum self-play learning, policy distillation, off-policy adaption, multi-head value estimation, and Monte-Carlo tree-search, in training and playing a large pool of heroes, meanwhile addressing the scalability issue skillfully. Tested on Honor of Kings, a popular MOBA game, we show how to build superhuman AI agents that can defeat top esports players. The superiority of our AI is demonstrated by the first large-scale performance test of MOBA AI agent in the literature.

Generative Modeling, such as various Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) models, has been applied to generate paintings and music.

Despite the exciting AI applications aforementioned, AI is still significantly lagging behind humans in creativity, which is often considered the ultimate moonshot for AI. Our work is inspired by Chinese calligraphy, which is a unique form of visual art where the character itself is an aesthetic painting. We also draw inspirations from paintings of the Abstract Expressionist movement in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the work by American painter Franz Kline. In this paper, we present a creative framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language Model to generate abstract artworks that have intrinsic meaning and aesthetic value, which is different from the existing work, such as image captioning and text-to-image generation, where the texts are the descriptions of the images.

However, existing methods usually view the dialogue context as a linear sequence of tokens and learn to generate the next word through token-level self-attention. Such token-level encoding hinders the exploration of discourse-level coherence among utterances. This paper presents DialogBERT, a novel conversational response generation model that enhances previous PLM-based dialogue models. DialogBERT employs a hierarchical Transformer architecture. To efficiently capture the discourse-level coherence among utterances, we propose two training objectives, including masked utterance regression and distributed utterance order ranking in analogy to the original BERT training. Experiments on three multi-turn conversation datasets show that our approach remarkably outperforms the baselines, such as BART and DialoGPT, in terms of quantitative evaluation.

We answer this question by presenting RPT, a denoising auto-encoder for tuple-to-X models (X could be tuple, token, label, JSON, and so on). RPT is pre-trained for a tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information extraction. In addition, we identify a series of research opportunities to advance the field of data preparation.

Specifically, UBAR is acquired by fine-tuning the large pre-trained unidirectional language model GPT-2 on the sequence of the entire dialog session which is composed of user utterance, belief state, database result, system act, and system response of every dialog turn. Additionally, UBAR is evaluated in a more realistic setting, where its dialog context has access to user utterances and all content it generated such as belief states, system acts, and system responses. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ datasets show that UBAR achieves state-of-the-art performances in multiple settings, improving the combined score of response generation, policy optimization, and end-to-end modeling by 4.7, 3.5, and 9.4 points respectively. Thorough analyses demonstrate that the session-level training sequence formulation and the generated dialog context are essential for UBAR to operate as a fully end-to-end task-oriented dialog system in real life. We also examine the transfer ability of UBAR to new domains with limited data and provide visualization and a case study to illustrate the advantages of UBAR in modeling on a dialog session level.

The Generative Pre-Training transformer is an effective autoregressive language model used for many tasks in Natural Language Processing, including sentence prediction and text classification.   This paper proposes a new application for this model and applies it in the context of lip reading, where it serves as a language model to convert visual speech in the form of visemes, to language in the form of words and sentences. The network uses the search for optimal perplexity to perform the viseme-to-word mapping and is thus a solution to the one-to-many mapping problem that exists whereby various words that sound different when spoken look identical. This paper proposes a method to tackle the one-to-many mapping problem when performing automated lip reading using solely visual cues in two separate scenarios: the first scenario is where the word boundary, that is, the beginning and the ending of a word, is unknown; and the second scenario is where the boundary is known.   Sentences from the benchmark BBC dataset ""Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild""(LRS2), are classified with a character error rate of 10.7% and a word error rate of 18.0%. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a method of predicting words through the use of perplexity analysis when only visual cues are present, using an autoregressive language model.

Until now, the existing models for this task suffer from the robustness issue, i.e., performances drop dramatically when testing on a different domain. We address this robustness issue by proposing a novel sequence-tagging-based model so that the search space is significantly reduced, yet the core of this task is still well covered. As a common issue of most tagging models for text generation, the model's outputs may lack fluency. To alleviate this issue, we inject the loss signal from BLEU or GPT-2 under a REINFORCE framework. Experiments show huge improvements of our model over the current state-of-the-art systems on domain transfer.

SSR provides more fine-grained learning signals for text representations by supervising the model to rewrite imperfect spans to ground truth, and it is more consistent than text infilling with many downstream seq2seq tasks that rewrite a source sentences into a target sentence. Our experiments with T5 models on various seq2seq tasks show that SSR can substantially improve seq2seq pre-training. Moreover, we observe SSR is especially helpful to improve pre-training a small-size seq2seq model with a powerful imperfect span generator, which indicates a new perspective of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller model for seq2seq pre-training.

However, it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous knowledge to retrieve or even discover the latest and novel knowledge in an efficient manner. To address such a problem, we propose EGFI for extracting and consolidating drug interactions from large-scale medical literature text data. Specifically, EGFI consists of two parts: classification and generation. In the classification part, EGFI encompasses the language model BioBERT which has been comprehensively pre-trained on biomedical corpus. In particular, we propose the multi-head attention mechanism and pack BiGRU to fuse multiple semantic information for rigorous context modeling. In the generation part, EGFI utilizes another pre-trained language model BioGPT-2 where the generation sentences are selected based on filtering rules. We evaluated the classification part on ""DDIs 2013"" dataset and ""DTIs"" dataset, achieving the FI score of 0.842 and 0.720 respectively. Moreover, we applied the classification part to distinguish high-quality generated sentences and verified with the exiting growth truth to confirm the filtered sentences. The generated sentences that are not recorded in DrugBank and DDIs 2013 dataset also demonstrate the potential of EGFI to identify novel drug relationships.

While usually large numbers of instances are available on the data side, often only very few text samples are available. To address this problem, we here propose a novel few-shot approach for this setting. Our approach automatically augments the data available for training by (i) generating new text samples based on replacing specific values by alternative ones from the same category, (ii) generating new text samples based on GPT-2, and (iii) proposing an automatic method for pairing the new text samples with data samples. As the text augmentation can introduce noise to the training data, we use cycle consistency as an objective, in order to make sure that a given data sample can be correctly reconstructed after having been formulated as text (and that text samples can be reconstructed from data). On both the E2E and WebNLG benchmarks, we show that this weakly supervised training paradigm is able to outperform fully supervised seq2seq models with less than 10% annotations. By utilizing all annotated data, our model can boost the performance of a standard seq2seq model by over 5 BLEU points, establishing a new state-of-the-art on both datasets.

In HINT, machines are tasked with learning how concepts are perceived from raw signals such as images (i.e., perception), how multiple concepts are structurally combined to form a valid expression (i.e., syntax), and how concepts are realized to afford various reasoning tasks (i.e., semantics), all in a weakly supervised manner. Focusing on systematic generalization, we carefully design a five-fold test set to evaluate both the interpolation and the extrapolation of learned concepts w.r.t. the three levels. Further, we design a few-shot learning split to determine whether or not models can rapidly learn new concepts and generalize them to more complex scenarios. To comprehend existing models' limitations, we undertake extensive experiments with various sequence-to-sequence models, including RNNs, Transformers, and GPT-3 (with the chain of thought prompting). The results indicate that current models struggle to extrapolate to long-range syntactic dependency and semantics. Models exhibit a considerable gap toward human-level generalization when evaluated with new concepts in a few-shot setting. Moreover, we discover that it is infeasible to solve HINT by merely scaling up the dataset and the model size; this strategy contributes little to the extrapolation of syntax and semantics.

  project called 'WenLan'",,,,cs.CV cs.IR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Multi-modal pre-training models have been intensively explored to bridge vision and language in recent years. However, most of them explicitly model the cross-modal interaction between image-text pairs, by assuming that there exists strong semantic correlation between the text and image modalities. Since this strong assumption is often invalid in real-world scenarios, we choose to implicitly model the cross-modal correlation for large-scale multi-modal pre-training, which is the focus of the Chinese project `WenLan' led by our team. Specifically, with the weak correlation assumption over image-text pairs, we propose a two-tower pre-training model called BriVL within the cross-modal contrastive learning framework. Unlike OpenAI CLIP that adopts a simple contrastive learning method, we devise a more advanced algorithm by adapting the latest method MoCo into the cross-modal scenario. By building a large queue-based dictionary, our BriVL can incorporate more negative samples in limited GPU resources. We further construct a large Chinese multi-source image-text dataset called RUC-CAS-WenLan for pre-training our BriVL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained BriVL model outperforms both UNITER and OpenAI CLIP on various downstream tasks.

Despite great advance, most of works only focus on improvement of architectures but pay little attention to the classification head. For years transformer models base exclusively on classification token to construct the final classifier, without explicitly harnessing high-level word tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer model called second-order transformer (SoT), exploiting simultaneously the classification token and word tokens for the classifier. Specifically, we empirically disclose that high-level word tokens contain rich information, which per se are very competent with the classifier and moreover, are complementary to the classification token. To effectively harness such rich information, we propose multi-headed global cross-covariance pooling with singular value power normalization, which shares similar philosophy and thus is compatible with the transformer block, better than commonly used pooling methods. Then, we study comprehensively how to explicitly combine word tokens with classification token for building the final classification head. For CV tasks, our SoT significantly improves state-of-the-art vision transformers on challenging benchmarks including ImageNet and ImageNet-A. For NLP tasks, through fine-tuning based on pretrained language transformers including GPT and BERT, our SoT greatly boosts the performance on widely used tasks such as CoLA and RTE.

However, with the trend towards automation and depersonalization of the entire integrated circuits (IC) industry, the conventional method, with the drawback of being relatively labor-intensive and sub-optimal, warrants further refinement. This technical dilemma remained until the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. This paper explores the possibility of applying LLMs to machine learning-based design and optimization of PCSELs. Specifically, we utilize GPT3.5 and GPT4. By simply having conversations, GPT assisted us with writing Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation code and deep reinforcement learning code to acquire the optimized PCSEL solution, spanning from the proposition of ideas to the realization of algorithms. Given that GPT will perform better when given detailed and specific questions, we break down the PCSEL design problem into a series of sub-problems and converse with GPT by posing open-ended heuristic questions rather than definitive commands. This paper shows that LLMs, such as ChatGPT, can guide the nanophotonic design and optimization processes, on both the conceptual and technical level, and we propose new human-AI co-design strategies and show their practical implications. We achieve a significant milestone for the first step towards an automated end to end nanophotonic design and production pipeline.

Among existing work, a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers.   In this paper, we present a novel SEmantic-based Question Answering method (SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler with synonym replacement, SEQA demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating stronger robustness.

The natural language-based vehicle search poses one new challenge of fine-grained understanding of both vision and language modalities. To connect language and vision, we propose to jointly train the state-of-the-art vision models with the transformer-based language model in an end-to-end manner. Except for the network structure design and the training strategy, several optimization objectives are also re-visited in this work. The qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method has achieved the 1st place on the 5th AI City Challenge, yielding competitive performance 18.69% MRR accuracy on the private test set.

In this work, we propose the DialoFlow model, in which we introduce a dynamic flow mechanism to model the context flow, and design three training objectives to capture the information dynamics across dialogue utterances by addressing the semantic influence brought about by each utterance in large-scale pre-training. Experiments on the multi-reference Reddit Dataset and DailyDialog Dataset demonstrate that our DialoFlow significantly outperforms the DialoGPT on the dialogue generation task. Besides, we propose the Flow score, an effective automatic metric for evaluating interactive human-bot conversation quality based on the pre-trained DialoFlow, which presents high chatbot-level correlation ($r=0.9$) with human ratings among 11 chatbots.

  Nie, Kyle Richardson",Investigating Transfer Learning in Multilingual Pre-trained Language Models through Chinese Natural Language Inference,accepted to ACL Findings 2021,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Multilingual transformers (XLM, mT5) have been shown to have remarkable transfer skills in zero-shot settings. Most transfer studies, however, rely on automatically translated resources (XNLI, XQuAD), making it hard to discern the particular linguistic knowledge that is being transferred, and the role of expert annotated monolingual datasets when developing task-specific models. We investigate the cross-lingual transfer abilities of XLM-R for Chinese and English natural language inference (NLI), with a focus on the recent large-scale Chinese dataset OCNLI. To better understand linguistic transfer, we created 4 categories of challenge and adversarial tasks (totaling 17 new datasets) for Chinese that build on several well-known resources for English (e.g., HANS, NLI stress-tests). We find that cross-lingual models trained on English NLI do transfer well across our Chinese tasks (e.g., in 3/4 of our challenge categories, they perform as well/better than the best monolingual models, even on 3/5 uniquely Chinese linguistic phenomena such as idioms, pro drop). These results, however, come with important caveats: cross-lingual models often perform best when trained on a mixture of English and high-quality monolingual NLI data (OCNLI), and are often hindered by automatically translated resources (XNLI-zh). For many phenomena, all models continue to struggle, highlighting the need for our new diagnostics to help benchmark Chinese and cross-lingual models.

Compared to DNNs with vanilla artificial neurons, the biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) contains a diverse population of spiking neurons, making it naturally powerful on state representation with spatial and temporal information. Based on a hybrid learning framework, where a spike actor-network infers actions from states and a deep critic network evaluates the actor, we propose a Population-coding and Dynamic-neurons improved Spiking Actor Network (PDSAN) for efficient state representation from two different scales: input coding and neuronal coding. For input coding, we apply population coding with dynamically receptive fields to directly encode each input state component. For neuronal coding, we propose different types of dynamic-neurons (containing 1st-order and 2nd-order neuronal dynamics) to describe much more complex neuronal dynamics. Finally, the PDSAN is trained in conjunction with deep critic networks using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3-PDSAN). Extensive experimental results show that our TD3-PDSAN model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art models on four OpenAI gym benchmark tasks. It is an important attempt to improve RL with SNN towards the effective computation satisfying biological plausibility.

However, efficiency issues of these large-scale PLMs limit their utilization in real-world scenarios. We present a suite of cost-effective techniques for the use of PLMs to deal with the efficiency issues of pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. (1) We introduce knowledge inheritance to accelerate the pre-training process by exploiting existing PLMs instead of training models from scratch. (2) We explore the best practice of prompt tuning with large-scale PLMs. Compared with conventional fine-tuning, prompt tuning significantly reduces the number of task-specific parameters. (3) We implement a new inference toolkit, namely InfMoE, for using large-scale PLMs with limited computational resources. Based on our cost-effective pipeline, we pre-train two models: an encoder-decoder bilingual model with 11 billion parameters (CPM-2) and its corresponding MoE version with 198 billion parameters. In our experiments, we compare CPM-2 with mT5 on downstream tasks. Experimental results show that CPM-2 has excellent general language intelligence. Moreover, we validate the efficiency of InfMoE when conducting inference of large-scale models having tens of billions of parameters on a single GPU.

Apart from the traditional code completion methods, which only support single token completion at minimal positions, recent studies show the ability to provide longer code completion at more flexible positions. However, such frequently triggered and longer completion results reduce the overall precision as they generate more invalid results. Moreover, different studies are mostly incompatible with each other. Thus, it is vital to develop an ensemble framework that can combine results from multiple models to draw merits and offset defects of each model.   This paper conducts a coding simulation to collect data from code context and different code completion models and then apply the data in two tasks. First, we introduce an acceptance model which can dynamically control whether to display completion results to the developer. It uses simulation features to predict whether correct results exist in the output of these models. Our best model reduces the percentage of false-positive completion from 55.09% to 17.44%. Second, we design a fusion ranking scheme that can automatically identify the priority of the completion results and reorder the candidates from multiple code completion models. This scheme is flexible in dealing with various models, regardless of the type or the length of their completion results. We integrate this ranking scheme with two frequency models and a GPT-2 styled language model, along with the acceptance model to yield 27.80% and 37.64% increase in TOP1 and TOP5 accuracy, respectively. In addition, we propose a new code completion evaluation metric, Benefit-Cost Ratio(BCR), taking into account the benefit of keystrokes saving and hidden cost of completion list browsing, which is closer to real coder experience scenario.

2108.02984,Wei Wang,"Wei Wang, Piji Li, Hai-Tao Zheng",Sentence Semantic Regression for Text Generation,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be briefly divided into two phases: \textbf{idea reasoning} and \textbf{surface realization}. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which will be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization aims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the information distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular token-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer from many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and realize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence Semantic Regression (\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling. For idea reasoning, two architectures \textbf{SSR-AR} and \textbf{SSR-NonAR} are designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like GPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a mixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better consistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as well as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct experiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation, dialogue generation, and sentence infilling. The results show that SSR can obtain better performance in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation.

  (CCS), 2021",,,,cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Given a set of unlabeled images or (image, text) pairs, contrastive learning aims to pre-train an image encoder that can be used as a feature extractor for many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose EncoderMI, the first membership inference method against image encoders pre-trained by contrastive learning. In particular, given an input and a black-box access to an image encoder, EncoderMI aims to infer whether the input is in the training dataset of the image encoder. EncoderMI can be used 1) by a data owner to audit whether its (public) data was used to pre-train an image encoder without its authorization or 2) by an attacker to compromise privacy of the training data when it is private/sensitive. Our EncoderMI exploits the overfitting of the image encoder towards its training data. In particular, an overfitted image encoder is more likely to output more (or less) similar feature vectors for two augmented versions of an input in (or not in) its training dataset. We evaluate EncoderMI on image encoders pre-trained on multiple datasets by ourselves as well as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder, which is pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet and released by OpenAI. Our results show that EncoderMI can achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall. We also explore a countermeasure against EncoderMI via preventing overfitting through early stopping. Our results show that it achieves trade-offs between accuracy of EncoderMI and utility of the image encoder, i.e., it can reduce the accuracy of EncoderMI, but it also incurs classification accuracy loss of the downstream classifiers built based on the image encoder.

  Xiong, Lu Zhang",Lyra: A Benchmark for Turducken-Style Code Generation,,,,,cs.SE cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recently, neural techniques have been used to generate source code automatically. While promising for declarative languages, these approaches achieve much poorer performance on datasets for imperative languages. Since a declarative language is typically embedded in an imperative language (i.e., the turducken-style programming) in real-world software development, the promising results on declarative languages can hardly lead to significant reduction of manual software development efforts. In this paper, we define a new code generation task: given a natural language comment, this task aims to generate a program in a base imperative language with an embedded declarative language. To our knowledge, this is the first turducken-style code generation task. For this task, we present Lyra: a dataset in Python with embedded SQL. This dataset contains 2,000 carefully annotated database manipulation programs from real-world projects. Each program is paired with both a Chinese comment and an English comment. In our experiment, we adopted Transformer, BERT-style, and GPT-style models as baselines. In the best setting, the generation performance of GPT-style models is better than others, where the AST exact matching accuracy is 24% and 25.5% when using Chinese and English comments, respectively.

Recently, large-scale generative pre-trained language models (GPLMs) have been shown to be effective in text generation tasks. However, existing MAS models cannot leverage GPLMs' powerful generation ability. To fill this research gap, we aim to study two research questions: 1) how to inject visual information into GPLMs without hurting their generation ability; and 2) where is the optimal place in GPLMs to inject the visual information? In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method to construct vision guided (VG) GPLMs for the MAS task using attention-based add-on layers to incorporate visual information while maintaining their original text generation ability. Results show that our best model significantly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art model by 5.7 ROUGE-1, 5.3 ROUGE-2, and 5.1 ROUGE-L scores on the How2 dataset, and our visual guidance method contributes 83.6% of the overall improvement.

Many recent studies formalize MWP as a generation task and have adopted sequence-to-sequence models to transform problem descriptions to mathematical expressions. However, mathematical expressions are prone to minor mistakes while the generation objective does not explicitly handle such mistakes. To address this limitation, we devise a new ranking task for MWP and propose Generate & Rank, a multi-task framework based on a generative pre-trained language model. By joint training with generation and ranking, the model learns from its own mistakes and is able to distinguish between correct and incorrect expressions. Meanwhile, we perform tree-based disturbance specially designed for MWP and an online update to boost the ranker. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the benchmark and the results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in all datasets.

However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance.

Recently, prompting methods over pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown promising results for few-shot learning in ToD. To better utilize the power of PLMs, this paper proposes Comprehensive Instruction (CINS) that exploits PLMs with extra task-specific instructions. We design a schema (definition, constraint, prompt) of instructions and their customized realizations for three important downstream tasks in ToD, i.e. intent classification, dialog state tracking, and natural language generation. A sequence-to-sequence model (T5) is adopted to solve these three tasks in a unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on these ToD tasks in realistic few-shot learning scenarios with small validation data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed CINS approach consistently improves techniques that finetune PLMs with raw input or short prompts.

To this end, we propose three novel types of interpretable topological features for this task based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) which is currently understudied in the field of NLP. We empirically show that the features derived from the BERT model outperform count- and neural-based baselines up to 10\% on three common datasets, and tend to be the most robust towards unseen GPT-style generation models as opposed to existing methods. The probing analysis of the features reveals their sensitivity to the surface and syntactic properties.

To capture the important information of the input passage we first automatically generate(rather than extracting) keyphrases, thus this task is reduced to keyphrase-question-answer triplet joint generation.

The so-called negative instances may be positive, which is known as the fake negative problem. To address the above issue, we employ pre-trained language models, such as the DialoGPT to construct more challenging negative instances to enhance the model robustness. Specifically, we provide garbled context to the pre-trained model to generate responses and filter the fake negative ones. In this way, our negative instances are fluent, context-related, and more challenging for the model to learn, while can not be positive. Extensive experiments show that our method brings significant and stable improvements on the dialogue response selection capacity.

However, in practical settings TableQA systems are deployed over table corpora having topic and word distributions quite distinct from BERT's pretraining corpus. In this work we simulate the practical topic shift scenario by designing novel challenge benchmarks WikiSQL-TS and WikiTQ-TS, consisting of train-dev-test splits in five distinct topic groups, based on the popular WikiSQL and WikiTableQuestions datasets. We empirically show that, despite pre-training on large open-domain text, performance of models degrades significantly when they are evaluated on unseen topics. In response, we propose T3QA (Topic Transferable Table Question Answering) a pragmatic adaptation framework for TableQA comprising of: (1) topic-specific vocabulary injection into BERT, (2) a novel text-to-text transformer generator (such as T5, GPT2) based natural language question generation pipeline focused on generating topic specific training data, and (3) a logical form reranker. We show that T3QA provides a reasonably good baseline for our topic shift benchmarks. We believe our topic split benchmarks will lead to robust TableQA solutions that are better suited for practical deployment.

Particularly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various molecular generation and prediction tasks. In cases where labeled data is scarce, GNNs can be pre-trained on unlabeled molecular data to first learn the general semantic and structural information before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, most existing self-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs only focus on node-level or graph-level tasks. These approaches cannot capture the rich information in subgraphs or graph motifs. For example, functional groups (frequently-occurred subgraphs in molecular graphs) often carry indicative information about the molecular properties. To bridge this gap, we propose Motif-based Graph Self-supervised Learning (MGSSL) by introducing a novel self-supervised motif generation framework for GNNs. First, for motif extraction from molecular graphs, we design a molecule fragmentation method that leverages a retrosynthesis-based algorithm BRICS and additional rules for controlling the size of motif vocabulary. Second, we design a general motif-based generative pre-training framework in which GNNs are asked to make topological and label predictions. This generative framework can be implemented in two different ways, i.e., breadth-first or depth-first. Finally, to take the multi-scale information in molecular graphs into consideration, we introduce a multi-level self-supervised pre-training. Extensive experiments on various downstream benchmark tasks show that our methods outperform all state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we propose a simple training strategy called ""Pseudo-to-Real"" for high-memory-footprint-required large models. Pseudo-to-Real is compatible with large models with architecture of sequential layers. We demonstrate a practice of pretraining unprecedented 10-trillion-parameter model, an order of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art, on solely 512 GPUs within 10 days. Besides demonstrating the application of Pseudo-to-Real, we also provide a technique, Granular CPU offloading, to manage CPU memory for training large model and maintain high GPU utilities.

However, large language model pre-training costs intensive computational resources and most of the models are trained from scratch without reusing the existing pre-trained models, which is wasteful. In this paper, we propose bert2BERT, which can effectively transfer the knowledge of an existing smaller pre-trained model (e.g., BERT_BASE) to a large model (e.g., BERT_LARGE) through parameter initialization and significantly improve the pre-training efficiency of the large model. Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving on Transformer-based language model, and further improve it by proposing advanced knowledge for large model's initialization. In addition, a two-stage pre-training method is proposed to further accelerate the training process. We did extensive experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that (1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models. In particular, bert2BERT saves about 45% and 47% computational cost of pre-training BERT_BASE and GPT_BASE by reusing the models of almost their half sizes.

The former is to detect input tokens corrupted by a generator and recover their original identities from plausible candidates, while the latter is to further distinguish corruptions of a same original sequence from those of others. As such, eHealth can learn language semantics at both token and sequence levels. Extensive experiments on 11 Chinese biomedical language understanding tasks of various forms verify the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

The current best conversational models, which are either good chit-chatters (e.g., BlenderBot) or goal-oriented systems (e.g., MinTL), are language models (LMs) fine-tuned on large conversational datasets. Training these models is expensive, both in terms of computational resources and time, and it is hard to keep them up to date with new conversational skills. A simple yet unexplored solution is prompt-based few-shot learning (Brown et al. 2020) which does not require gradient-based fine-tuning but instead uses a few examples in the LM context as the only source of learning. In this paper, we explore prompt-based few-shot learning in dialogue tasks. We benchmark LMs of different sizes in nine response generation tasks, which include four knowledge-grounded tasks, a task-oriented generations task, three open-chat tasks, and controlled stylistic generation, and five conversational parsing tasks, which include dialogue state tracking, graph path generation, persona information extraction, document retrieval, and internet query generation. The current largest released LM (GPT-J-6B) using prompt-based few-shot learning, and thus requiring no training, achieves competitive performance to fully trained state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel prompt-based few-shot classifier, that also does not require any fine-tuning, to select the most appropriate prompt given a dialogue history. Finally, by combining the power of prompt-based few-shot learning and a Skill Selector, we create an end-to-end chatbot named the Few-Shot Bot (FSB), which automatically selects the most appropriate conversational skill, queries different knowledge bases or the internet, and uses the retrieved knowledge to generate a human-like response, all using only few dialogue examples per skill.

This can place a learning agent in dangerous and potentially catastrophic system states. Current approaches for tackling safe learning in RL simultaneously trade-off safe exploration and task fulfillment. In this paper, we introduce a new generation of RL solvers that learn to minimise safety violations while maximising the task reward to the extent that can be tolerated by the safe policy. Our approach introduces a novel two-player framework for safe RL called Distributive Exploration Safety Training Algorithm (DESTA). The core of DESTA is a game between two adaptive agents: Safety Agent that is delegated the task of minimising safety violations and Task Agent whose goal is to maximise the environment reward. Specifically, Safety Agent can selectively take control of the system at any given point to prevent safety violations while Task Agent is free to execute its policy at any other states. This framework enables Safety Agent to learn to take actions at certain states that minimise future safety violations, both during training and testing time, while Task Agent performs actions that maximise the task performance everywhere else. Theoretically, we prove that DESTA converges to stable points enabling safety violations of pretrained policies to be minimised. Empirically, we show DESTA's ability to augment the safety of existing policies and secondly, construct safe RL policies when the Task Agent and Safety Agent are trained concurrently. We demonstrate DESTA's superior performance against leading RL methods in Lunar Lander and Frozen Lake from OpenAI gym.

We motivate our paradigm through a variational perspective, where the learning objective can be decomposed into two terms: task learning on the current task distribution, and curriculum update to a new task distribution. Local optimization over the second term suggests that the curriculum should gradually expand the training tasks from easy to hard. Our VACL algorithm implements this variational paradigm with two practical components, task expansion and entity progression, which produces training curricula over both the task configurations as well as the number of entities in the task. Experiment results show that VACL solves a collection of sparse-reward problems with a large number of agents. Particularly, using a single desktop machine, VACL achieves 98% coverage rate with 100 agents in the simple-spread benchmark and reproduces the ramp-use behavior originally shown in OpenAI's hide-and-seek project.

As a recognized standard for testing artificial intelligence, various human-computer gaming AI systems (AIs) have been developed such as the Libratus, OpenAI Five and AlphaStar, beating professional human players. The rapid development of human-computer gaming AIs indicate a big step of decision making intelligence, and it seems that current techniques can handle very complex human-computer games. So, one natural question raises: what are the possible challenges of current techniques in human-computer gaming, and what are the future trends? To answer the above question, in this paper, we survey recent successful game AIs, covering board game AIs, card game AIs, first-person shooting game AIs and real time strategy game AIs. Through this survey, we 1) compare the main difficulties among different kinds of games and the corresponding techniques utilized for achieving professional human level AIs; 2) summarize the mainstream frameworks and techniques that can be properly relied on for developing AIs for complex human-computer gaming; 3) raise the challenges or drawbacks of current techniques in the successful AIs; and 4) try to point out future trends in human-computer gaming AIs. Finally, we hope this brief review can provide an introduction for beginners, and inspire insights for researchers in the field of AI in human-computer gaming.

The core idea is to find the link between the internal knowledge behind questions and known triples of the knowledge base. Traditional KBQA task pipelines contain several steps, including entity recognition, entity linking, answering selection, etc. In this kind of pipeline methods, errors in any procedure will inevitably propagate to the final prediction. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Corpus Generation - Retrieve Method (CGRM) with Pre-training Language Model (PLM) for the KBQA task. The major novelty lies in the design of the new method, wherein our approach, the knowledge enhanced T5 (kT5) model aims to generate natural language QA pairs based on Knowledge Graph triples and directly solve the QA by retrieving the synthetic dataset. The new method can extract more information about the entities from PLM to improve accuracy and simplify the processes. We test our method on NLPCC-ICCPOL 2016 KBQA dataset, and the results show that our method improves the performance of KBQA and the out straight-forward method is competitive with the state-of-the-art.

Albeit many successes have been achieved by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in different fields, the underlying structure and learning dynamics of value function, especially with complex function approximation, are not fully understood. In this paper, we report that decreasing rank of $Q$-matrix widely exists during learning process across a series of continuous control tasks for different popular algorithms. We hypothesize that the low-rank phenomenon indicates the common learning dynamics of $Q$-matrix from stochastic high dimensional space to smooth low dimensional space. Moreover, we reveal a positive correlation between value matrix rank and value estimation uncertainty. Inspired by above evidence, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Low-rank Q-matrix Estimation (UA-LQE) algorithm as a general framework to facilitate the learning of value function. Through quantifying the uncertainty of state-action value estimation, we selectively erase the entries of highly uncertain values in state-action value matrix and conduct low-rank matrix reconstruction for them to recover their values. Such a reconstruction exploits the underlying structure of value matrix to improve the value approximation, thus leading to a more efficient learning process of value function. In the experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of UA-LQE in several representative OpenAI MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Accepted by AAAI 2022",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Pre-trained models have proved to be powerful in enhancing task-oriented dialog systems. However, current pre-training methods mainly focus on enhancing dialog understanding and generation tasks while neglecting the exploitation of dialog policy. In this paper, we propose GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that explicitly learns dialog policy from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduce a dialog act prediction task for policy optimization during pre-training and employ a consistency regularization term to refine the learned representation with the help of unlabeled dialogs. We also implement a gating mechanism to weigh suitable unlabeled dialog samples. Empirical results show that GALAXY substantially improves the performance of task-oriented dialog systems, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets: In-Car, MultiWOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1, improving their end-to-end combined scores by 2.5, 5.3 and 5.5 points, respectively. We also show that GALAXY has a stronger few-shot ability than existing models under various low-resource settings.

  spotlight",,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.

In the ""big model"" era, the rich features of DL-based software substantially rely on powerful DL models, e.g., BERT, GPT-3, and the recently emerging GPT-4, which are trained on the powerful cloud with large datasets. Hence, training effective DL models has become a vital stage in the whole software lifecycle. When training deep learning models, especially those big models, developers need to parallelize and distribute the computation and memory resources amongst multiple devices in the training process, which is known as distributed deep learning training, or distributed training for short. However, the unique challenges that developers encounter in distributed training process have not been studied in the software engineering community. Given the increasingly heavy dependence of current DL-based software on distributed training, this paper aims to fill in the knowledge gap and presents the first comprehensive study on developers' issues in distributed training. To this end, we analyze 1,131 real-world developers' issues about using these frameworks reported on Stack Overflow and GitHub. We construct a fine-grained taxonomy consisting of 30 categories regarding the fault symptoms and summarize common fix patterns for different symptoms. Based on the results, we suggest actionable implications on research avenues that can potentially facilitate the distributed training to develop DL-based software, such as focusing on the frequent and common fix patterns when designing testing or debugging tools, developing efficient testing and debugging techniques for communication configuration along with the synthesis of network configuration analysis, designing new multi-device checkpoint-and-replay techniques to help reproduction, and designing serverless APIs for cloud platforms.

GPT-3 has shown that scaling up pre-trained language models can further exploit their enormous potential. A unified framework named ERNIE 3.0 was recently proposed for pre-training large-scale knowledge enhanced models and trained a model with 10 billion parameters. ERNIE 3.0 outperformed the state-of-the-art models on various NLP tasks. In order to explore the performance of scaling up ERNIE 3.0, we train a hundred-billion-parameter model called ERNIE 3.0 Titan with up to 260 billion parameters on the PaddlePaddle platform. Furthermore, we design a self-supervised adversarial loss and a controllable language modeling loss to make ERNIE 3.0 Titan generate credible and controllable texts. To reduce the computation overhead and carbon emission, we propose an online distillation framework for ERNIE 3.0 Titan, where the teacher model will teach students and train itself simultaneously.

By routing tokens with a sparse gate to a few experts (i.e., a small pieces of the full model), MoE can easily increase the model parameters to a very large scale while keeping the computation cost in a constant level. Most existing works just initialize some random experts, set a fixed gating strategy (e.g., Top-k), and train the model from scratch in an ad-hoc way. We identify that these MoE models are suffering from the immature experts and unstable sparse gate, which are harmful to the convergence performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end MoE training framework called EvoMoE. EvoMoE starts from training one single expert and gradually evolves into a large and sparse MoE structure. EvoMoE mainly contains two phases: the expert-diversify phase to train the base expert for a while and spawn multiple diverse experts from it, and the gate-sparsify phase to learn an adaptive sparse gate and activate a dynamic number of experts. EvoMoE naturally decouples the joint learning of both the experts and the sparse gate and focuses on learning the basic knowledge with a single expert at the early training stage. Then it diversifies the experts and continues to train the MoE with a novel Dense-to-Sparse gate (DTS-Gate). Specifically, instead of using a permanent sparse gate, DTS-Gate begins as a dense gate that routes tokens to all experts, then gradually and adaptively becomes sparser while routes to fewer experts. Evaluations are conducted on three popular models and tasks, including RoBERTa for masked language modeling task, GPT for language modeling task and Transformer for machine translation task. The results show that EvoMoE outperforms existing baselines, including Switch, BASE Layer, Hash Layer and StableMoE.

Recently, Vision-Language Pre-training models have greatly improved the performance of the image-to-text generation tasks, but large-scale pre-training models for text-to-image synthesis task are still under-developed. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model. Based on the image quantization models, we formulate both image generation and text generation as autoregressive generative tasks conditioned on the text/image input. The bidirectional image-text generative modeling eases the semantic alignments across vision and language. For the text-to-image generation process, we further propose an end-to-end training method to jointly learn the visual sequence generator and the image reconstructor. To explore the landscape of large-scale pre-training for bidirectional text-image generation, we train a 10-billion parameter ERNIE-ViLG model on a large-scale dataset of 145 million (Chinese) image-text pairs which achieves state-of-the-art performance for both text-to-image and image-to-text tasks, obtaining an FID of 7.9 on MS-COCO for text-to-image synthesis and best results on COCO-CN and AIC-ICC for image captioning.

Since the inputs and outputs of SKG tasks are heterogeneous, they have been studied separately by different communities, which limits systematic and compatible research on SKG. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing the UnifiedSKG framework, which unifies 21 SKG tasks into a text-to-text format, aiming to promote systematic SKG research, instead of being exclusive to a single task, domain, or dataset. We use UnifiedSKG to benchmark T5 with different sizes and show that T5, with simple modifications when necessary, achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all of the 21 tasks. We further demonstrate that multi-task prefix-tuning improves the performance on most tasks, largely improving the overall performance. UnifiedSKG also facilitates the investigation of zero-shot and few-shot learning, and we show that T0, GPT-3, and Codex struggle in zero-shot and few-shot learning for SKG. We also use UnifiedSKG to conduct a series of controlled experiments on structured knowledge encoding variants across SKG tasks.

In this paper, we establish a Black-box Discrete Prompt Learning (BDPL) to resonate with pragmatic interactions between the cloud infrastructure and edge devices. Particularly, instead of fine-tuning the model in the cloud, we adapt PLMs by prompt learning, which efficiently optimizes only a few parameters of the discrete prompts. Moreover, we consider the scenario that we do not have access to the parameters and gradients of the pre-trained models, except for its outputs given inputs. This black-box setting secures the cloud infrastructure from potential attack and misuse to cause a single-point failure, which is preferable to the white-box counterpart by current infrastructures. Under this black-box constraint, we apply a variance-reduced policy gradient algorithm to estimate the gradients of parameters in the categorical distribution of each discrete prompt. In light of our method, the user devices can efficiently tune their tasks by querying the PLMs bounded by a range of API calls. Our experiments on RoBERTa and GPT-3 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement on eight benchmarks in a cloud-device collaboration manner. Finally, we conduct in-depth case studies to comprehensively analyze our method in terms of various data sizes, prompt lengths, training budgets, optimization objectives, prompt transferability, and explanations of the learned prompts.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.

Recent studies focus on scaling up the model size and the number of training data, which significantly increase the cost of model training. Different to these heavy-cost models, we introduce a lightweight image captioning framework (I-Tuning), which contains a small number of trainable parameters. We design a novel I-Tuning cross-attention module to connect the non-trainable pre-trained language decoder GPT2 and vision encoder CLIP-ViT. Since most parameters are not required to be updated during training, our framework is lightweight and fast. Experimental results conducted on three image captioning benchmarks reveal that our framework achieves comparable or better performance than the large-scale baseline systems. But our models contain up to 10 times fewer trainable parameters and require much fewer data for training compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

The current mainstream approach uses neural networks to encode natural language descriptions, and output abstract syntax trees (AST) at the decoder, then convert the AST into program code. While the generated code largely conforms to specific syntax rules, two problems are still ignored. One is missing program testing, an essential step in the process of complete code implementation; the other is only focusing on the syntax compliance of the generated code, while ignoring the more important program functional requirements. The paper proposes a CodeGen-Test model, which adds program testing steps and incorporates program testing information to iteratively generate code that meets the functional requirements of the program, thereby improving the quality of code generation. At the same time, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric, test accuracy (Test-Acc), which represents the proportion of passing program test in generated code. Different from the previous evaluation metric, which only evaluates the quality of code generation from the perspective of character similarity, the Test-Acc can evaluate the quality of code generation from the Program functions. Moreover, the paper evaluates the CodeGen-test model on a python data set ""hearthstone legend"". The experimental results show the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of generated code. Compared with the existing optimal model, CodeGen-Test model improves the Bleu value by 0.2%, Rouge-L value by 0.3% and Test-Acc by 6%.

Then, we train a tiny task model (e.g., LSTM) under the supervision of the synthesized dataset. This approach allows highly efficient inference as the final task model only has orders of magnitude fewer parameters comparing to PLMs (e.g., GPT2-XL). Apart from being annotation-free and efficient, we argue that \textsc{ZeroGen} can also provide useful insights from the perspective of data-free model-agnostic knowledge distillation, and unreferenced text generation evaluation.

Traditionally, modeling for such research has centered around a handful of paradigms. For instance, the prediction paradigm is frequently deployed for tasks such as molecular property prediction. To enhance the generation and decipherability of purely data-driven models, scholars have integrated biochemical domain knowledge into these molecular study models. This integration has sparked a surge in paradigm transfer, which is solving one molecular learning task by reformulating it as another one. With the emergence of Large Language Models, these paradigms have demonstrated an escalating trend towards harmonized unification. In this work, we delineate a literature survey focused on knowledge-informed molecular learning from the perspective of paradigm transfer. We classify the paradigms, scrutinize their methodologies, and dissect the contribution of domain knowledge. Moreover, we encapsulate prevailing trends and identify intriguing avenues for future exploration in molecular learning.

This would hinder the generalization of downstream dialogue models to open-domain topics. In this work, we leverage large language models for dialogue augmentation in the task of emotional support conversation (ESC). By treating dialogue augmentation as a dialogue completion task, we prompt a fine-tuned language model to complete full dialogues from available dialogue posts of various topics, which are then postprocessed based on heuristics. Applying this approach, we construct AugESC, an augmented dataset for the ESC task, which largely extends the scale and topic coverage of the crowdsourced ESConv corpus. Through comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach is superior to strong baselines of dialogue augmentation and that AugESC has comparable dialogue quality to the crowdsourced corpus. We also conduct human interactive evaluation and prove that post-training on AugESC improves downstream dialogue models' generalization ability to open-domain topics. These results suggest the utility of AugESC and highlight the potential of large language models in improving data-scarce dialogue generation tasks.

Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Trees (R2D2) makes it possible to scale to large language model pre-training even with complex tree encoder by introducing a heuristic pruning method. However, the rule-based pruning approach suffers from local optimum and slow inference issues. In this paper, we fix those issues in a unified method. We propose to use a top-down parser as a model-based pruning method, which also enables parallel encoding during inference. Typically, our parser casts parsing as a split point scoring task, which first scores all split points for a given sentence, and then recursively splits a span into two by picking a split point with the highest score in the current span. The reverse order of the splits is considered as the order of pruning in R2D2 encoder. Beside the bi-directional language model loss, we also optimize the parser by minimizing the KL distance between tree probabilities from parser and R2D2. Our experiments show that our Fast-R2D2 improves performance significantly in grammar induction and achieves competitive results in downstream classification tasks.

We adopt the matrix product operator (MPO, a tensor decomposition from quantum many-body physics) to reconstruct the parameter matrix in the expert layer and increase model capacity for pre-trained language models by sharing parameters of the central tensor (containing the core information) among different experts while enabling the specificity through the auxiliary tensors (complementing the central tensor) of different experts. To address the unbalanced optimization issue, we further design the gradient mask strategy for the MPO-based MoE architecture. Extensive experiments based on T5 and GPT-2 show improved performance and efficiency of the pre-trained language model (27.2x reduction in total parameters for the superior model performance, compared with the Switch Transformers).

Existing deep-learning approaches model code generation as text generation, either constrained by grammar structures in decoder, or driven by pre-trained language models on large-scale code corpus (e.g., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5). However, few of them account for compilability of the generated programs. To improve compilability of the generated programs, this paper proposes COMPCODER, a three-stage pipeline utilizing compiler feedback for compilable code generation, including language model fine-tuning, compilability reinforcement, and compilability discrimination. Comprehensive experiments on two code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, improving the success rate of compilation from 44.18 to 89.18 in code completion on average and from 70.3 to 96.2 in text-to-code generation, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art CodeGPT.

This requires PLMs to integrate the information from all the sources in a lifelong manner. Although this goal could be achieved by exhaustive pre-training on all the existing data, such a process is known to be computationally expensive. To this end, we propose ELLE, aiming at efficient lifelong pre-training for emerging data. Specifically, ELLE consists of (1) function preserved model expansion, which flexibly expands an existing PLM's width and depth to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition; and (2) pre-trained domain prompts, which disentangle the versatile knowledge learned during pre-training and stimulate the proper knowledge for downstream tasks. We experiment ELLE with streaming data from 5 domains on BERT and GPT. The results show the superiority of ELLE over various lifelong learning baselines in both pre-training efficiency and downstream performances.

However, previous works have relied heavily on elaborate components for a specific language model, usually recurrent neural network (RNN), which makes themselves unwieldy in practice to fit into other neural language models, such as Transformer and GPT-2. In this paper, we introduce the Dependency-based Mixture Language Models. In detail, we first train neural language models with a novel dependency modeling objective to learn the probability distribution of future dependent tokens given context. We then formulate the next-token probability by mixing the previous dependency modeling probability distributions with self-attention.

Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the \textit{homogeneous word embeddings} caused by reduced capacity, and \textit{varied distribution of weights}. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin.

Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy that we call Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC). In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We illustrate the pertinence of these design choices and explore alternatives on a number of datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet). While our pre-training strategy works with a vanilla Transformer, we also propose a conceptually simple, but highly effective, addition to the decoder that allows learnable skip-connections to encoder$'$s feature layers, which further improves the performance.

In addition, the generated dance sequence also needs to maintain temporal coherency with different music genres. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel music-to-dance framework, Bailando, with two powerful components: 1) a choreographic memory that learns to summarize meaningful dancing units from 3D pose sequence to a quantized codebook, 2) an actor-critic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that composes these units to a fluent dance coherent to the music. With the learned choreographic memory, dance generation is realized on the quantized units that meet high choreography standards, such that the generated dancing sequences are confined within the spatial constraints. To achieve synchronized alignment between diverse motion tempos and music beats, we introduce an actor-critic-based reinforcement learning scheme to the GPT with a newly-designed beat-align reward function. Extensive experiments on the standard benchmark demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, the learned choreographic memory is shown to discover human-interpretable dancing-style poses in an unsupervised manner.

One is to predict the pseudo codes via masked language modeling in encoder output, like HuBERT model, while the other lets the decoder learn to reconstruct pseudo codes autoregressively instead of generating textual scripts. In this way, the decoder learns to reconstruct original speech information with codes before learning to generate correct text. Comprehensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the proposed Speech2C can relatively reduce the word error rate (WER) by 19.2% over the method without decoder pre-training, and also outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT on fine-tuning subsets of 10h and 100h.

Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a computational approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the correlation between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are applied to generate and evaluate light-weighted flying car concepts inspired by nature. The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.

In this paper, we propose $\textbf{QRelScore}$, a context-aware $\underline{\textbf{Rel}}$evance evaluation metric for $\underline{\textbf{Q}}$uestion Generation. Based on off-the-shelf language models such as BERT and GPT2, QRelScore employs both word-level hierarchical matching and sentence-level prompt-based generation to cope with the complicated reasoning and diverse generation from multiple evidences, respectively. Compared with existing metrics, our experiments demonstrate that QRelScore is able to achieve a higher correlation with human judgments while being much more robust to adversarial samples.

While they are designed for text-prompted generation, it remains an open question how the generation process could be guided by modalities beyond text such as images. In this work, we propose a training-free framework, called MAGIC (iMAge-Guided text generatIon with CLIP), for plugging in visual controls in the generation process and enabling LMs to perform multimodal tasks (e.g., image captioning) in a zero-shot manner. MAGIC is a simple yet efficient plug-and-play framework, which directly combines an off-the-shelf LM (i.e., GPT-2) and an image-text matching model (i.e., CLIP) for image-grounded text generation. During decoding, MAGIC influences the generation of the LM by introducing a CLIP-induced score, called magic score, which regularizes the generated result to be semantically related to a given image while being coherent to the previously generated context. Notably, the proposed decoding scheme does not involve any gradient update operation, therefore being computationally efficient. On the challenging task of zero-shot image captioning, MAGIC outperforms the state-of-the-art method by notable margins with a nearly 27 times decoding speedup. MAGIC is a flexible framework and is theoretically compatible with any text generation tasks that incorporate image grounding. In the experiments, we showcase that it is also capable of performing visually grounded story generation given both an image and a text prompt.

In this paper, we propose the first VAE framework empowered with adaptive GPT-2s (AdaVAE). Different from existing systems, we unify both the encoder\&decoder of the VAE model using GPT-2s with adaptive parameter-efficient components, and further introduce Latent Attention operation to better construct latent space from transformer models.

We explore the current capability of LLMs in providing an answer with a deliberative exchange of different perspectives to an ethical quandary, in the approach of Socratic philosophy, instead of providing a closed answer like an oracle. We propose a model that searches for different ethical principles applicable to the ethical quandary and generates an answer conditioned on the chosen principles through prompt-based few-shot learning.

  Workshops (CVPRW)",,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The purpose of image inpainting is to recover scratches and damaged areas using context information from remaining parts. In recent years, thanks to the resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image inpainting task has made great breakthroughs. However, most of the work consider insufficient types of mask, and their performance will drop dramatically when encountering unseen masks. To combat these challenges, we propose a simple yet general method to solve this problem based on the LaMa image inpainting framework, dubbed GLaMa. Our proposed GLaMa can better capture different types of missing information by using more types of masks. By incorporating more degraded images in the training phase, we can expect to enhance the robustness of the model with respect to various masks. In order to yield more reasonable results, we further introduce a frequency-based loss in addition to the traditional spatial reconstruction loss and adversarial loss. In particular, we introduce an effective reconstruction loss both in the spatial and frequency domain to reduce the chessboard effect and ripples in the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can boost the performance over the original LaMa method for each type of mask on FFHQ, ImageNet, Places2 and WikiArt dataset. The proposed GLaMa was ranked first in terms of PSNR, LPIPS and SSIM in the NTIRE 2022 Image Inpainting Challenge Track 1 Unsupervised.

Concretely, our method first adopts Gaussian mixture distribution to estimate the prototypical clusters for all categories. Then we assign each cluster to the corresponding label by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem. Given an example, its prediction is calibrated by the likelihood of prototypical clusters. Experimental results show that prototypical calibration yields a substantial improvement on a diverse set of tasks. Extensive analysis across different scales also indicates that our method calibrates the decision boundary as expected, greatly improving the robustness of GPT to templates, permutations, and class imbalance.

However, the success rate of existing models is low, especially for complex programming tasks. One of the reasons is that language models lack awareness of program semantics, resulting in incorrect programs, or even programs which do not compile. In this paper, we systematically study whether automated program repair (APR) techniques can fix the incorrect solutions produced by language models in LeetCode contests. The goal is to study whether APR techniques can enhance reliability in the code produced by large language models. Our study revealed that: (1) automatically generated code shares common programming mistakes with human-crafted solutions, indicating APR techniques may have potential to fix auto-generated code; (2) given bug location information provided by a statistical fault localization approach, the newly released Codex edit mode, which supports editing code, is similar to or better than existing Java repair tools TBar and Recoder in fixing incorrect solutions. By analyzing the experimental results generated by these tools, we provide several suggestions: (1) enhancing APR tools to surpass limitations in patch space (e.g., introducing more flexible fault localization) is desirable; (2) as large language models can derive more fix patterns by training on more data, future APR tools could shift focus from adding more fix patterns to synthesis/semantics based approaches, (3) combination of language models with APR to curate patch ingredients, is worth studying.

This work concerns addressing two major problems in existing Arabic PLMs which constraint progress of the Arabic NLU and NLG fields.First, existing Arabic PLMs are not well-explored and their pre-trainig can be improved significantly using a more methodical approach. Second, there is a lack of systematic and reproducible evaluation of these models in the literature. In this work, we revisit both the pre-training and evaluation of Arabic PLMs. In terms of pre-training, we explore improving Arabic LMs from three perspectives: quality of the pre-training data, size of the model, and incorporating character-level information. As a result, we release three new Arabic BERT-style models ( JABER, Char-JABER, and SABER), and two T5-style models (AT5S and AT5B). In terms of evaluation, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to systematically evaluate the performance of existing state-of-the-art models on ALUE that is a leaderboard-powered benchmark for Arabic NLU tasks, and on a subset of the ARGEN benchmark for Arabic NLG tasks. We show that our models significantly outperform existing Arabic PLMs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on discriminative and generative Arabic NLU and NLG tasks.

  Wang, Jie Tang",GraphMAE: Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoders,11 pages; Accepted to KDD'22,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been extensively explored in recent years. Particularly, generative SSL has seen emerging success in natural language processing and other AI fields, such as the wide adoption of BERT and GPT. Despite this, contrastive learning-which heavily relies on structural data augmentation and complicated training strategies-has been the dominant approach in graph SSL, while the progress of generative SSL on graphs, especially graph autoencoders (GAEs), has thus far not reached the potential as promised in other fields. In this paper, we identify and examine the issues that negatively impact the development of GAEs, including their reconstruction objective, training robustness, and error metric. We present a masked graph autoencoder GraphMAE that mitigates these issues for generative self-supervised graph pretraining. Instead of reconstructing graph structures, we propose to focus on feature reconstruction with both a masking strategy and scaled cosine error that benefit the robust training of GraphMAE. We conduct extensive experiments on 21 public datasets for three different graph learning tasks. The results manifest that GraphMAE-a simple graph autoencoder with careful designs-can consistently generate outperformance over both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines. This study provides an understanding of graph autoencoders and demonstrates the potential of generative self-supervised pre-training on graphs.

  Li, Junjie Bai",Parameter-Efficient Sparsity for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning,This paper is published in IJCAI 2022,,,,cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  With the dramatically increased number of parameters in language models, sparsity methods have received ever-increasing research focus to compress and accelerate the models. While most research focuses on how to accurately retain appropriate weights while maintaining the performance of the compressed model, there are challenges in the computational overhead and memory footprint of sparse training when compressing large-scale language models. To address this problem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to reduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven criteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then we investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and derive two obvious characteristics i.e., low-rankness and structuredness. Based on that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven importance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score matrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and parameter-efficient. Experiments with diverse networks (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets demonstrate PST performs on par or better than previous sparsity methods, despite only training a small number of parameters. For instance, compared with previous sparsity methods, our PST only requires 1.5% trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance on BERT.

However, auto-regressive PLMs are challenged by recent emerging numerical reasoning datasets, such as TAT-QA, due to the error-prone implicit calculation. In this paper, we present TaCube, to pre-compute aggregation/arithmetic results for the table in advance, so that they are handy and readily available for PLMs to answer numerical reasoning questions. TaCube systematically and comprehensively covers a collection of computational operations over table segments. By simply concatenating TaCube to the input sequence of PLMs, it shows significant experimental effectiveness. TaCube promotes the F1 score from 49.6% to 66.2% on TAT-QA and achieves new state-of-the-art results on WikiTQ (59.6% denotation accuracy). TaCube's improvements on numerical reasoning cases are even more notable: on TAT-QA, TaCube promotes the exact match accuracy of BART-large by 39.6% on sum, 52.5% on average, 36.6% on substraction, and 22.2% on division.

Previous works on sentence scoring mainly adopted either causal language modeling (CLM) like GPT or masked language modeling (MLM) like BERT, which have some limitations: 1) CLM only utilizes unidirectional information for the probability estimation of a sentence without considering bidirectional context, which affects the scoring quality; 2) MLM can only estimate the probability of partial tokens at a time and thus requires multiple forward passes to estimate the probability of the whole sentence, which incurs large computation and time cost. In this paper, we propose \textit{Transcormer} -- a Transformer model with a novel \textit{sliding language modeling} (SLM) for sentence scoring. Specifically, our SLM adopts a triple-stream self-attention mechanism to estimate the probability of all tokens in a sentence with bidirectional context and only requires a single forward pass. SLM can avoid the limitations of CLM (only unidirectional context) and MLM (multiple forward passes) and inherit their advantages, and thus achieve high effectiveness and efficiency in scoring. Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than other language modelings.

A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on unseen tasks regardless of changes in the number of agents.

In these settings, performing actions at each time step quickly accumulates costs leading to vastly suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, repeatedly acting produces wear and tear and ultimately, damage. Determining \textit{when to act} is crucial for achieving successful outcomes and yet, the challenge of efficiently \textit{learning} to behave optimally when actions incur minimally bounded costs remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework named \textbf{L}earnable \textbf{I}mpulse \textbf{C}ontrol \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{A}lgorithm (LICRA), for learning to optimally select both when to act and which actions to take when actions incur costs. At the core of LICRA is a nested structure that combines RL and a form of policy known as \textit{impulse control} which learns to maximise objectives when actions incur costs. We prove that LICRA, which seamlessly adopts any RL method, converges to policies that optimally select when to perform actions and their optimal magnitudes. We then augment LICRA to handle problems in which the agent can perform at most $k<\infty$ actions and more generally, faces a budget constraint. We show LICRA learns the optimal value function and ensures budget constraints are satisfied almost surely. We demonstrate empirically LICRA's superior performance against benchmark RL methods in OpenAI gym's \textit{Lunar Lander} and in \textit{Highway} environments and a variant of the Merton portfolio problem within finance.

  https://github.com/Jxu-Thu/DITTO",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  While large-scale neural language models, such as GPT2 and BART, have achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding algorithms (\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora (e.g., 0.02\% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that 1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO} (Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data. Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization (CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method.

We introduce a lemma based on existing theoretical results in reinforcement learning (RL) to measure the relativity between two arbitrary MDPs, that is the difference between any two cumulative expected returns defined on different policies and environment dynamics. Based on this lemma, we propose two new algorithms referred to as Relative Policy Optimization (RPO) and Relative Transition Optimization (RTO), which can offer fast policy transfer and dynamics modeling, respectively. RPO updates the policy using the relative policy gradient to transfer the policy evaluated in one environment to maximize the return in another, while RTO updates the parameterized dynamics model (if there exists) using the relative transition gradient to reduce the gap between the dynamics of the two environments. Then, integrating the two algorithms offers the complete algorithm Relative Policy-Transition Optimization (RPTO), in which the policy interacts with the two environments simultaneously, such that data collections from two environments, policy and transition updates are completed in one closed loop to form a principled learning framework for policy transfer.

Usually, expensive text-code paired data is essential for training a code generation model. Recently, thanks to the success of pre-training techniques, large language models are trained on large-scale unlabelled code corpora and perform well in code generation. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage an unlabelled code corpus to train a model for library-oriented code generation. Since it is a common practice for programmers to reuse third-party libraries, in which case the text-code paired data are harder to obtain due to the huge number of libraries. We observe that library-oriented code snippets are more likely to share similar code sketches. Hence, we present CERT with two steps: a sketcher generates the sketch, then a generator fills the details in the sketch. Both the sketcher and the generator are continually pre-trained upon a base model using unlabelled data. Furthermore, we craft two benchmarks named PandasEval and NumpyEval to evaluate library-oriented code generation. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive performance of CERT. For example, it surpasses the base model by an absolute 15.67% improvement in terms of pass@1 on PandasEval. Our work is available at https://github.com/microsoft/PyCodeGPT.

However, few studies investigate if these two essential capabilities can be learned together and boost each other, making a versatile and powerful multi-modal foundation model. In this work, we disclose the potential of symmetric generative vision-language pre-training in learning to write and paint concurrently, and propose a new unified modal model, named DaVinci, trained with prefix language modeling and prefix image modeling, a simple generative self-supervised objective on image-text pairs. Thanks to the proposed prefix multi-modal modeling framework, DaVinci is simple to train, scalable to huge data, adaptable to both writing and painting tasks, and also strong on other vision, text, and multi-modal understanding tasks. DaVinci achieves competitive performance on a wide range of 27 generation/understanding tasks and demonstrates the superiority of combining vision/language generative pre-training. Furthermore, we carefully benchmark the performance of different vision-language pre-training objectives on different scales of pre-training datasets on a heterogeneous and broad distribution coverage. Our results demonstrate the potential of exploiting self-supervision in both language and vision inputs, and establish new, stronger baselines for future comparisons at different data scales.

  https://openreview.net/forum?id=2nocgE1m0A",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This paper focuses on the data augmentation for low-resource NLP tasks where the training set is limited. The existing solutions either leverage task-independent heuristic rules (e.g., Synonym Replacement) or fine-tune general-purpose pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT2) using the limited training instances to produce new synthetic data. Consequently, they have trivial task-specific knowledge and are limited to yielding low-quality synthetic data. To combat this issue, we propose Knowledge Mixture Data Augmentation Model (KnowDA) which is an Seq2Seq language model pre-trained on a mixture of diverse NLP tasks under a novel framework of Knowledge Mixture Training (KoMT). The goal of KoMT is to condense diverse NLP task-specific knowledge into the single KnowDA model (i.e., all-in-one) such that KnowDA could utilize these knowledge to quickly grasp the inherent synthesis law of the target task through limited training instances. Specifically, KoMT reformulates input examples from various heterogeneous NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text format, and employs denoising training objectives in different granularity to learn to reconstruct partial or complete samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first attempt to apply 100+ NLP multi-task training for data augmentation. Extensive experiments show that i) the synthetic data produced by KnowDA successfully improves performance of the strong pre-trained language models (i.e., Bert, ALBert and Deberta) by a large margin on the low-resource NLP benchmark FewGLUE, CoNLL'03 and WikiAnn; ii) KnowDA successfully transfers the task knowledge to NLP tasks whose types are seen and unseen in KoMT.

However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7\% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2\% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

In this paper, compact speaker dependent learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training (SAT) and test time unsupervised speaker adaptation for state-of-the-art Conformer based end-to-end ASR systems. The sensitivity during adaptation to supervision error rate is reduced using confidence score based selection of the more ""trustworthy"" subset of speaker specific data. A confidence estimation module is used to smooth the over-confident Conformer decoder output probabilities before serving as confidence scores. The increased data sparsity due to speaker level data selection is addressed using Bayesian estimation of LHUC parameters. Experiments on the 300-hour Switchboard corpus suggest that the proposed LHUC-SAT Conformer with confidence score based test time unsupervised adaptation outperformed the baseline speaker independent and i-vector adapted Conformer systems by up to 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.2% absolute (9.0%, 7.9%, and 8.9% relative) word error rate (WER) reductions on the NIST Hub5'00, RT02, and RT03 evaluation sets respectively.

Solving Chinese character riddles is a challenging task that demands understanding of character glyph, general knowledge, and a grasp of figurative language. In this paper, we construct a \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{C}haracter riddle dataset named CC-Riddle, which covers the majority of common simplified Chinese characters. The construction process is a combination of web crawling, language model generation and manual filtering. In generation stage, we input the Chinese phonetic alphabet, glyph and meaning of the solution character into the generation model, which then produces multiple riddle descriptions. The generated riddles are then manually filtered and the final CC-Riddle dataset is composed of both human-written riddles and these filtered, generated riddles. In order to assess the performance of language models on the task of solving character riddles, we use retrieval-based, generative and multiple-choice QA strategies to test three language models: BERT, ChatGPT and ChatGLM.

The NKB is in the form of additional knowledgeable memory slots to the FFN and the memory-like architecture makes it highly interpretable and flexible. When injecting extra knowledge with the Salient Span Masking (SSM) pretraining objective, we fix the original pretrained model and train only the NKB. This training strategy makes sure the general language modeling ability of the original pretrained model is not influenced. By mounting the NKB onto the T5 model, we verify its strong ability to store extra factual knowledge based on three closed-book question answering datasets. Also, we prove that mounting the NKB will not degrade the general language modeling ability of T5 through two representative tasks, summarization and machine translation. Further, we thoroughly analyze the interpretability of the NKB and reveal the meaning of its keys and values in a human-readable way. Finally, we show the flexibility of the NKB by directly modifying its value vectors to update the factual knowledge stored in it.

Prior work typically learns/finetunes a language model (LM) to perform individual or specific subsets of operations. Recent research has studied combining operations in a plug-and-play manner, often with costly search or optimization in the complex sequence space. This paper proposes a new efficient approach for composable text operations in the compact latent space of text. The low-dimensionality and differentiability of the text latent vector allow us to develop an efficient sampler based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given arbitrary plug-in operators (e.g., attribute classifiers). By connecting pretrained LMs (e.g., GPT2) to the latent space through efficient adaption, we then decode the sampled vectors into desired text sequences.

2208.06677,Xingyu Xie,Xingyu Xie and Pan Zhou and Huan Li and Zhouchen Lin and Shuicheng Yan,Adan: Adaptive Nesterov Momentum Algorithm for Faster Optimizing Deep Models,,,,,cs.LG math.OC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In deep learning, different kinds of deep networks typically need different optimizers, which have to be chosen after multiple trials, making the training process inefficient. To relieve this issue and consistently improve the model training speed across deep networks, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum algorithm, Adan for short. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which avoids the extra overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point. Then Adan adopts NME to estimate the gradient's first- and second-order moments in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove that Adan finds an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within $O(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the non-convex stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan consistently surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on vision, language, and RL tasks and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks and frameworks, e.g., ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, DETR, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT, GPT-2, MAE, e.t.c., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size, e.g., from 1k to 32k. Code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/Adan, and has been used in multiple popular deep learning frameworks or projects.

Accepted by ICSE 2023",,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Code completion, a highly valuable topic in the software development domain, has been increasingly promoted for use by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). To date, visible LLM-based code completion frameworks such as GitHub Copilot and GPT are trained using deep learning over vast quantities of unstructured text and open source code. As the paramount component and the cornerstone in daily programming tasks, code completion has largely boosted professionals' efficiency in building real-world software systems. In contrast to this flourishing market, we find that code completion systems often output suspicious results, and to date, an automated testing and enhancement framework for code completion systems is not available. This research proposes CCTEST, a framework to test and repair code completion systems in blackbox settings. CCTEST features a set of novel mutation strategies, namely program structure-correlated (PSC) mutations, to generate mutated code completion inputs. Then, it detects inconsistent outputs, representing possibly erroneous cases, from all the completed code cases. Moreover, CCTEST repairs the code completion outputs by selecting the output that mostly reflects the ""average"" appearance of all output cases, as the final output of the code completion systems. We detected a total of 33,540 inputs (with a true positive rate of 86%) that can trigger erroneous cases from eight popular LLM-based code completion systems. With repairing, we show that the accuracy of code completion systems is notably increased by 40% and 67% with respect to BLEU score and Levenshtein edit similarity.

The research on zero-shot dialogue generation without cumbersome language models is limited due to lacking corresponding parallel dialogue corpora. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Multilingual learning framework for Zero-shot Dialogue Generation (dubbed as MulZDG) that can effectively transfer knowledge from an English corpus with large-scale training samples to a non-English corpus with zero samples. Besides, MulZDG can be viewed as a multilingual data augmentation method to improve the performance of the resource-rich language. First, we construct multilingual code-switching dialogue datasets via translation utterances randomly selected from monolingual English datasets. Then we employ MulZDG to train a unified multilingual dialogue model based on the code-switching datasets. The MulZDG can conduct implicit semantic alignment between different languages. Experiments on DailyDialog and DSTC7 datasets demonstrate that MulZDG not only achieve competitive performance under zero-shot case compared to training with sufficient examples but also greatly improve the performance of the source language.

Bigger is better has been the norm. Optical computing has been reawakened as a potential solution to large-scale computing through optical accelerators that carry out linear operations while reducing electrical power. However, to achieve efficient computing with light, creating and controlling nonlinearity optically rather than electronically remains a challenge. This study explores a reservoir computing (RC) approach whereby a 14 mm long few-mode waveguide in LiNbO3 on insulator is used as a complex nonlinear optical processor. A dataset is encoded digitally on the spectrum of a femtosecond pulse which is then launched in the waveguide. The output spectrum depends nonlinearly on the input. We experimentally show that a simple digital linear classifier with 784 parameters using the output spectrum from the waveguide as input increased the classification accuracy of several databases compared to non-transformed data, approximately 10$\%$. In comparison, a deep digital neural network (NN) with 40000 parameters was necessary to achieve the same accuracy. Reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $\sim$50 illustrates that a compact optical RC approach can perform on par with a deep digital NN.

Conventional KBQG works generated questions from fact triples in the knowledge graph, which could not express complex operations like aggregation and comparison in SPARQL. Moreover, due to the costly annotation of large-scale SPARQL-question pairs, KBQG from SPARQL under low-resource scenarios urgently needs to be explored. Recently, since the generative pre-trained language models (PLMs) typically trained in natural language (NL)-to-NL paradigm have been proven effective for low-resource generation, e.g., T5 and BART, how to effectively utilize them to generate NL-question from non-NL SPARQL is challenging. To address these challenges, AutoQGS, an auto-prompt approach for low-resource KBQG from SPARQL, is proposed. Firstly, we put forward to generate questions directly from SPARQL for the KBQG task to handle complex operations. Secondly, we propose an auto-prompter trained on large-scale unsupervised data to rephrase SPARQL into NL description, smoothing the low-resource transformation from non-NL SPARQL to NL question with PLMs. Experimental results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComlexWebQuestions 1.1, and PathQuestions show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, a corpus of 330k factoid complex question-SPARQL pairs is generated for further KBQG research.

In this work, we introduce Plug-and-Play Story Teller (PPST) and improve image-to-story generation by: 1) alleviating the data scarcity problem by incorporating large pre-trained models, namely CLIP and GPT-2, to facilitate a fluent image-to-text generation with minimal supervision, and 2) enabling a more style-relevant generation by incorporating stylistic adapters to control the story generation. We conduct image-to-story generation experiments with non-styled, romance-styled, and action-styled PPST approaches and compare our generated stories with those of previous work over three aspects, i.e., story coherence, image-story relevance, and style fitness, using both automatic and human evaluation. The results show that PPST improves story coherence and has better image-story relevance, but has yet to be adequately stylistic.

Specifically, we augment the multitask training and zero-shot evaluation with retrieval from a large-scale task-agnostic unlabeled corpus. In order to incorporate multiple potentially noisy retrieved augmentations, we further propose a novel $\text{augmentation fusion}$ module leveraging perceiver resampler and gated cross-attention.

It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B -- the largest Chinese language model -- across related benchmarks. Finally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization, without quantization aware training and with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models. More importantly, the property allows its effective inference on 4$\times$RTX 3090 (24G) or 8$\times$RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most ever affordable GPUs required for using 100B-scale models. The GLM-130B model weights are publicly accessible and its code, training logs, related toolkit, and lessons learned are open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B .

We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations. Specifically, we employ GPT-3 Codex as the LM. In the parsing stage, with only a few in-context exemplars, Codex is able to identify the part of the task input that cannot be answerable by the original programming language, correctly generate API calls to prompt Codex to solve the unanswerable part, and identify where to place the API calls while being compatible with the original grammar. In the execution stage, Codex can perform versatile functionalities (e.g., commonsense QA, information extraction) given proper prompts in the API calls. Binder achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging. Note that previous best systems are all finetuned on tens of thousands of task-specific samples, while Binder only uses dozens of annotations as in-context exemplars without any training.

Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like ""Let's think step by step"" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the ""Let's think step by step"" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

However, cutting-edge language models have proven difficult to reliably generalize to a broad range of numbers, although they have shown proficiency in reasoning over common and simple numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel method to elicit and exploit the numerical reasoning knowledge hidden in pre-trained language models using simple anchor numbers. Concretely, we first leverage simple numbers as anchors to probe the implicitly inferred arithmetic expressions from language models, and then explicitly apply the expressions on complex numbers to get corresponding answers. To inversely elicit arithmetic expressions, we transform and formulate the task as an analytically solvable linear system. Experimental results on several numerical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves numerical reasoning capabilities of existing LMs. More importantly, our approach is training-free and simply works in the inference phase, making it highly portable and achieving consistent performance benefits across a variety of language models (GPT-3, T5, BART, etc) in all zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.

However, online reinforcement learning of a GPT-2 based dialog system (DS), together with a end-to-end user simulator (US), has not ever been explored. Moreover, a drawback with existing GPT-2 based TOD systems is that they mostly employ the whole dialog history as input, which brings inefficiencies in memory and compute. In this paper, we first propose Simplified Generative Architectures (SGA) for DS and US respectively, both based on GPT-2 but using shortened history. Then, we successfully develop Jointly Reinforced US and DS, called SGA-JRUD. Our DS with the proposed SGA, when only supervised trained, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ2.1 and is more compute-efficient in both training and generation. Extensive experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 further show the superiority of SGA-JRUD in both offline and online evaluations.

Back translation (BT), which generates pseudo-parallel data by translating in-domain spoken language texts into sign glosses, has been applied to alleviate the data scarcity problem. However, the lack of large-scale high-quality domain spoken language text data limits the effect of BT. In this paper, to overcome the limitation, we propose a Prompt based domain text Generation (PGEN) approach to produce the large-scale in-domain spoken language text data. Specifically, PGEN randomly concatenates sentences from the original in-domain spoken language text data as prompts to induce a pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2) to generate spoken language texts in a similar style. Experimental results on three benchmarks of sign language gloss translation in varied languages demonstrate that BT with spoken language texts generated by PGEN significantly outperforms the compared methods. In addition, as the scale of spoken language texts generated by PGEN increases, the BT technique can achieve further improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Yet, human values can vary under diverse cultural conditions. Therefore, we introduce a framework for value-aligned classification that performs prediction based on explicitly written human values in the command. Along with the task, we propose a practical approach that distills value-aligned knowledge from large-scale language models (LLMs) to construct value-aligned classifiers in two steps. First, we generate value-aligned training data from LLMs by prompt-based few-shot learning. Next, we fine-tune smaller classification models with the generated data for the task.

First, it is unclear whether we can leverage pretrained language models to design, for example, GPT-2 based USs, to catch up and interact with the recently advanced GPT-2 based DSs. Second, an important ingredient in a US is that the user goal can be effectively incorporated and tracked; but how to flexibly integrate goal state tracking and develop an end-to-end trainable US for multi-domains has remained to be a challenge. In this work, we propose a generative user simulator (GUS) with GPT-2 based architecture and goal state tracking towards addressing the above two challenges. Extensive experiments are conducted on MultiWOZ2.1. Different DSs are trained via RL with GUS, the classic agenda-based user simulator (ABUS) and other ablation simulators respectively, and are compared for cross-model evaluation, corpus-based evaluation and human evaluation. The GUS achieves superior results in all three evaluation tasks.

Google's Imagen follows this research trend and outperforms DALLE2 as the best model for text-to-image generation. However, Imagen merely uses a T5 language model for text processing, which cannot ensure learning the semantic information of the text. Furthermore, the Efficient UNet leveraged by Imagen is not the best choice in image processing. To address these issues, we propose the Swinv2-Imagen, a novel text-to-image diffusion model based on a Hierarchical Visual Transformer and a Scene Graph incorporating a semantic layout. In the proposed model, the feature vectors of entities and relationships are extracted and involved in the diffusion model, effectively improving the quality of generated images. On top of that, we also introduce a Swin-Transformer-based UNet architecture, called Swinv2-Unet, which can address the problems stemming from the CNN convolution operations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by using three real-world datasets, i.e., MSCOCO, CUB and MM-CelebA-HQ. The experimental results show that the proposed Swinv2-Imagen model outperforms several popular state-of-the-art methods.

  clarifications",,,,cs.LG cs.PF,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Training deep learning models can be computationally expensive. Prior works have shown that increasing the batch size can potentially lead to better overall throughput. However, the batch size is frequently limited by the accelerator memory capacity due to the activations/feature maps stored for the training backward pass, as larger batch sizes require larger feature maps to be stored. Transformer-based models, which have recently seen a surge in popularity due to their good performance and applicability to a variety of tasks, have a similar problem. To remedy this issue, we propose Tempo, a new approach to efficiently use accelerator (e.g., GPU) memory resources for training Transformer-based models. Our approach provides drop-in replacements for the GELU, LayerNorm, and Attention layers, reducing the memory usage and ultimately leading to more efficient training. We implement Tempo and evaluate the throughput, memory usage, and accuracy/loss on the BERT Large pre-training task. We demonstrate that Tempo enables up to 2x higher batch sizes and 16% higher training throughput over the state-of-the-art baseline. We also evaluate Tempo on GPT2 and RoBERTa models, showing 19% and 26% speedup over the baseline.

Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e., BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical NLP tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record.

Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state.

In this work, we propose a simple technique that significantly boosts the performance of LLMs without adding computational cost. Our key observation is that, by performing the next token prediction task with randomly selected past tokens masked out, we can improve the quality of the learned representations for downstream language understanding tasks. We hypothesize that randomly masking past tokens prevents over-attending to recent tokens and encourages attention to tokens in the distant past. We find that our method, Forgetful Causal Masking (FCM), significantly improves both few-shot and finetuning performance of PaLM. We further consider a simple extension, T-FCM, which introduces bidirectional context to causal language model without altering the sequence order, and further improves finetuning performance.

Such facts are encoded implicitly within their many parameters, making it difficult to verify or manipulate what knowledge has been learned. Language models have recently been extended to multilingual language models (MLLMs), enabling knowledge to be learned across hundreds of languages. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs contain facts in an explicit triple format, which require careful and costly curation and are only available in a few high-resource languages, restricting their research and application. To address these issues, we propose to enhance MLLMs with knowledge from multilingual knowledge graphs (MLKGs) so as to tackle language and knowledge graph tasks across many languages, including low-resource ones. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight adapter set to enhance MLLMs with cross-lingual entity alignment and facts from MLKGs for many languages. Experiments on common benchmarks show that such enhancement benefits both MLLMs and MLKGs, achieving: (1) comparable or improved performance for knowledge graph completion and entity alignment relative to baselines, especially for low-resource languages (for which knowledge graphs are unavailable); and (2) improved MLLM performance on language understanding tasks that require multilingual factual knowledge; all while maintaining performance on other general language tasks.

However, these conclusions are mostly drawn from in-domain evaluations over the full training set. In this paper, we present comparisons between PERMs and finetuning from three new perspectives: (1) the effect of sample and model size to in-domain evaluations, (2) generalization to unseen domains and new datasets, and (3) the faithfulness of generations. Our results show that for in-domain settings (a) there is a cross point of sample size for which PERMs will perform better than finetuning when training with fewer samples, and (b) larger PLMs have larger cross points. For cross-domain and cross-dataset cases, we show that (a) Adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019) performs the best amongst all the PERMs studied here, and (b) it outperforms finetuning if the task dataset is below a certain size.

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained LMs, such as BERT and GPT, may store linguistic and relational knowledge. In particular, LMs are able to answer ``fill-in-the-blank'' questions when given a pre-defined relation category. Instead of focusing on pre-defined relations, we create an OIE benchmark aiming to fully examine the open relational information present in the pre-trained LMs. We accomplish this by turning pre-trained LMs into zero-shot OIE systems. Surprisingly, pre-trained LMs are able to obtain competitive performance on both standard OIE datasets (CaRB and Re-OIE2016) and two new large-scale factual OIE datasets (TAC KBP-OIE and Wikidata-OIE) that we establish via distant supervision. For instance, the zero-shot pre-trained LMs outperform the F1 score of the state-of-the-art supervised OIE methods on our factual OIE datasets without needing to use any training sets.

An ideal solution for such a problem would be integrating both the text and graph structure information with large language models and graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the problem becomes very challenging when graphs are large due to the high computational complexity brought by training large language models and GNNs together. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective solution to learning on large text-attributed graphs by fusing graph structure and language learning with a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, called GLEM. Instead of simultaneously training large language models and GNNs on big graphs, GLEM proposes to alternatively update the two modules in the E-step and M-step. Such a procedure allows training the two modules separately while simultaneously allowing the two modules to interact and mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments on multiple data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The new dataset provides a natural mixture of various reasoning types and requires multi-hop reasoning. Moreover, the IF game-based construction procedure requires much less human interventions than previous ones. Different from existing benchmarks, our dataset focuses on the assessment of functional commonsense knowledge rules rather than factual knowledge. Hence, in order to achieve higher performance on our tasks, models need to effectively utilize such functional knowledge to infer the outcomes of actions, rather than relying solely on memorizing facts.

However, neglecting grammar constraints is a fatal drawback of commonly used sequence-based code generation. In this paper, we devise a pushdown automaton (PDA)-based methodology to address this problem, exploiting the principle that PL is a subset of PDA recognizable language and code accepted by PDA is grammatical. Specifically, we construct a PDA module and design an algorithm to constrain the generation of sequence-based models to ensure grammatical correctness. Guided by this methodology, we further propose CodePAD, a sequence-based code generation framework equipped with a PDA module, to integrate the deduction of PDA into deep learning. Additionally, this framework can leverage states of PDA deduction (including state representation, state prediction task, and joint prediction with state) to assist models in learning PDA deduction. To comprehensively evaluate CodePAD, we construct a PDA for Python and conduct extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets. CodePAD can leverage existing sequence-based models, and we show that it can achieve 100\% grammatical correctness percentage on these benchmark datasets. Thus, it relatively improve 17\% CodeBLEU on CONALA, 8\% EM on DJANGO, and 15\% CodeBLEU on JUICE-10K compared to base models. In addition, our method significantly enhances pre-trained models, e.g., CodeBLEU of CodeGen-350M improvement from 3.21 to 21.54 on MBPP in zero-shot setting.

HCNet uses a multi-hash codebook as the main memory place and the whole memory procedure consists of three phases: multi-hash addressing, memory restoring, and feature shrinking. We also propose a new CTR model named MemoNet which combines HCNet with a DNN backbone. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets and online test show that MemoNet reaches superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, MemoNet shows scaling law of large language model in NLP, which means we can enlarge the size of the codebook in HCNet to sustainably obtain performance gains.

For this purpose, we establish a data-driven environment by downloading $43$ years of hourly global weather data from the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and train a few deep neural networks with about $256$ million parameters in total. The spatial resolution of forecast is $0.25^\circ\times0.25^\circ$, comparable to the ECMWF Integrated Forecast Systems (IFS). More importantly, for the first time, an AI-based method outperforms state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods in terms of accuracy (latitude-weighted RMSE and ACC) of all factors (e.g., geopotential, specific humidity, wind speed, temperature, etc.) and in all time ranges (from one hour to one week). There are two key strategies to improve the prediction accuracy: (i) designing a 3D Earth Specific Transformer (3DEST) architecture that formulates the height (pressure level) information into cubic data, and (ii) applying a hierarchical temporal aggregation algorithm to alleviate cumulative forecast errors. In deterministic forecast, Pangu-Weather shows great advantages for short to medium-range forecast (i.e., forecast time ranges from one hour to one week). Pangu-Weather supports a wide range of downstream forecast scenarios, including extreme weather forecast (e.g., tropical cyclone tracking) and large-member ensemble forecast in real-time. Pangu-Weather not only ends the debate on whether AI-based methods can surpass conventional NWP methods, but also reveals novel directions for improving deep learning weather forecast systems.

Specifically, given the candidate human-written prompts for a task, ZPS labels a set of unlabeled data with a prompt ensemble and uses the pseudo-labels for prompt selection. Experiments show that ZPS improves over prior methods by a sizeable margin in zero-label performance. We also extend ZPS to a few-shot setting and show its advantages over strong baselines such as prompt tuning and model tuning.

More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the original data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher. We evaluate our method on the most common patient outcome, i.e., the 30-day readmission rate. The experimental results show that deep models can improve their predictive performance with the augmented data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

However, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem remains a challenge in many NLP tasks, limiting the real-world deployment of these methods. This paper presents the first attempt at creating a unified benchmark named GLUE-X for evaluating OOD robustness in NLP models, highlighting the importance of OOD robustness and providing insights on how to measure the robustness of a model and how to improve it. The benchmark includes 13 publicly available datasets for OOD testing, and evaluations are conducted on 8 classic NLP tasks over 21 popularly used PLMs, including GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. Our findings confirm the need for improved OOD accuracy in NLP tasks, as significant performance degradation was observed in all settings compared to in-distribution (ID) accuracy.

In this paper, we present FolkScope, an intention knowledge graph construction framework to reveal the structure of humans' minds about purchasing items. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large language models~(LLMs) and human-in-the-loop annotation to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. LLMs first generate intention assertions via e-commerce-specific prompts to explain shopping behaviors, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA, MadeOf, UsedFor, etc. Then we annotate plausibility and typicality labels of sampled intentions as training data in order to populate human judgments to all automatic generations. Last, to structurize the assertions, we propose pattern mining and conceptualization to form more condensed and abstract knowledge. Extensive evaluations and studies demonstrate that our constructed knowledge graph can well model e-commerce knowledge and have many potential applications.

Meanwhile, to better evaluate few-shot summarizers, under the principles of diversity and robustness, we assemble and release a new benchmark \textsc{SummZoo}. It consists of $8$ summarization tasks with multiple sets of few-shot samples for each task, covering diverse domains.

Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, and LLaMA family. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node.

Recent years witnessed significant progress in standardized benchmarking for English. Benchmarks such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, or KILT have become de facto standard tools to compare large language models. Following the trend to replicate GLUE for other languages, the KLEJ benchmark has been released for Polish. In this paper, we evaluate the progress in benchmarking for low-resourced languages. We note that only a handful of languages have such comprehensive benchmarks. We also note the gap in the number of tasks being evaluated by benchmarks for resource-rich English/Chinese and the rest of the world. In this paper, we introduce LEPISZCZE (the Polish word for glew, the Middle English predecessor of glue), a new, comprehensive benchmark for Polish NLP with a large variety of tasks and high-quality operationalization of the benchmark. We design LEPISZCZE with flexibility in mind. Including new models, datasets, and tasks is as simple as possible while still offering data versioning and model tracking. In the first run of the benchmark, we test 13 experiments (task and dataset pairs) based on the five most recent LMs for Polish. We use five datasets from the Polish benchmark and add eight novel datasets.

A Model Robustness Perspective,UNDER REVIEW,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Pre-trained code generation models (PCGMs) have been widely applied in neural code generation which can generate executable code from functional descriptions in natural languages, possibly together with signatures. Despite substantial performance improvement of PCGMs, the role of method names in neural code generation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we study and demonstrate the potential of benefiting from method names to enhance the performance of PCGMs, from a model robustness perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, named RADAR (neuRAl coDe generAtor Robustifier). RADAR consists of two components: RADAR-Attack and RADAR-Defense. The former attacks a PCGM by generating adversarial method names as part of the input, which are semantic and visual similar to the original input, but may trick the PCGM to generate completely unrelated code snippets. As a countermeasure to such attacks, RADAR-Defense synthesizes a new method name from the functional description and supplies it to the PCGM. Evaluation results show that RADAR-Attack can reduce the CodeBLEU of generated code by 19.72% to 38.74% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5) in the fine-tuning code generation task, and reduce the Pass@1 of generated code by 32.28% to 44.42% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., Replit, CodeGen, and CodeT5+) in the zero-shot code generation task. Moreover, RADAR-Defense is able to reinstate the performance of PCGMs with synthesized method names. These results highlight the importance of good method names in neural code generation and implicate the benefits of studying model robustness in software engineering.

Based on exhaustive text cues in ""[CONTEXT]"", CLIP model is aware of different contexts, e.g. background, style, viewpoint, and exhibits unprecedented robustness against a wide range of distribution shifts. However, recent works find further fine-tuning of CLIP models improves accuracy but sacrifices the robustness on downstream tasks. We conduct an empirical investigation to show fine-tuning will corrupt the context-aware ability of pre-trained CLIP features. To solve this problem, we propose Context-Aware Robust Fine-tuning (CAR-FT). CAR-FT regularizes the model during fine-tuning to capture the context information. Specifically, we use zero-shot prompt weights to get the context distribution contained in the image. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between context distributions induced by original/fine-tuned CLIP models, CAR-FT makes the context-aware ability of CLIP inherited into downstream tasks, and achieves both higher In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy. The experimental results show CAR-FT achieves superior robustness on five OOD test datasets of ImageNet, and meanwhile brings accuracy gains on nine downstream tasks. Additionally, CAR-FT surpasses previous Domain Generalization (DG) methods and gets 78.5% averaged accuracy on DomainBed benchmark, building the new state-of-the-art.

  Tat Lee, Arturs Backurs, Nenghai Yu, Jiang Bian",Exploring the Limits of Differentially Private Deep Learning with Group-wise Clipping,25 pages,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Differentially private deep learning has recently witnessed advances in computational efficiency and privacy-utility trade-off. We explore whether further improvements along the two axes are possible and provide affirmative answers leveraging two instantiations of \emph{group-wise clipping}. To reduce the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \emph{per-layer clipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given training epoch constraints, hence attaining similar or better task performance within less wall time. To explore the limits of scaling (pretrained) models in differentially private deep learning, we privately fine-tune the 175 billion-parameter GPT-3. We bypass scaling challenges associated with clipping gradients that are distributed across multiple devices with \emph{per-device clipping} that clips the gradient of each model piece separately on its host device. Privately fine-tuning GPT-3 with per-device clipping achieves a task performance at $\epsilon=1$ better than what is attainable by non-privately fine-tuning the largest GPT-2 on a summarization task.

We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers. Our results provide an initial step toward discovering what language models know, distinct from what they say, even when we don't have access to explicit ground truth labels.

  2023 (ICSE 2023)",,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,"  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models. The beta version of Elixir is now available at https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/feature/elixir.

However, this is usually performed in a centralized learning fashion, ignoring the privacy sensitivity issue of (annotated) data used in multiple tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose FewFedWeight, a few-shot federated learning framework across multiple tasks, to achieve the best of both worlds: privacy preservation and cross-task generalization. FewFedWeight trains client models in isolated devices without sharing data. It broadcasts the global model in the server to each client and produces pseudo data for clients so that knowledge from the global model can be explored to enhance few-shot learning of each client model. An energy-based algorithm is further proposed to weight pseudo samples in order to reduce the negative impact of noise from the generated pseudo data. Adaptive model weights of client models are also tuned according to their performance. We use these model weights to dynamically aggregate client models to update the global model. Experiments on 118 NLP tasks show that FewFedWeight can significantly improve the performance of client models on 61% tasks with an average performance improvement rate of 30.5% over the baseline and substantially outperform FedAvg and other decentralized learning methods.

In a zero-shot setting, this task is more challenging since no data is available to train customized models like Retriever-Readers. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown their power in zero-shot ODQA with direct prompting methods, but these methods are still far from releasing the full powerfulness of LLMs only in an implicitly invoking way. In this paper, we propose a Self-Prompting framework to explicitly utilize the massive knowledge stored in the parameters of LLMs and their strong instruction understanding abilities. Concretely, we prompt LLMs step by step to generate multiple pseudo QA pairs with background passages and explanations from scratch and then use those generated elements for in-context learning.

Over the years, graph learning has transcended from graph theory to graph data mining. With the advent of representation learning, it has attained remarkable performance in diverse scenarios. Owing to its extensive application prospects, graph learning attracts copious attention. While some researchers have accomplished impressive surveys on graph learning, they failed to connect related objectives, methods, and applications in a more coherent way. As a result, they did not encompass current ample scenarios and challenging problems due to the rapid expansion of graph learning. Particularly, large language models have recently had a disruptive effect on human life, but they also show relative weakness in structured scenarios. The question of how to make these models more powerful with graph learning remains open. Different from previous surveys on graph learning, we provide a holistic review that analyzes current works from the perspective of graph structure, and discusses the latest applications, trends, and challenges in graph learning. Specifically, we commence by proposing a taxonomy and then summarize the methods employed in graph learning. We then provide a detailed elucidation of mainstream applications.

To extend the benefits of BLOOM to other languages without incurring prohibitively large costs, it is desirable to adapt BLOOM to new languages not seen during pretraining. In this work, we apply existing language adaptation strategies to BLOOM and benchmark its zero-shot prompting performance on eight new languages in a resource-constrained setting. We find language adaptation to be effective at improving zero-shot performance in new languages. Surprisingly, we find that adapter-based finetuning is more effective than continued pretraining for large models. In addition, we discover that prompting performance is not significantly affected by language specifics, such as the writing system. It is primarily determined by the size of the language adaptation data. We also add new languages to BLOOMZ, which is a multitask finetuned version of BLOOM capable of following task instructions zero-shot. We find including a new language in the multitask fine-tuning mixture to be the most effective method to teach BLOOMZ a new language. We conclude that with sufficient training data language adaptation can generalize well to diverse languages. Our code is available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/multilingual-modeling.

  Zhao",Large Language Models are Better Reasoners with Self-Verification,,,,,cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recently, with the chain of thought (CoT) prompting, large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-3, have shown strong reasoning ability in several natural language processing tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning. However, LLMs with CoT require multi-step prompting and multi-token prediction, which is highly sensitive to individual mistakes and vulnerable to error accumulation. The above issues make the LLMs need the ability to verify the answers. In fact, after inferring conclusions in some thinking decision tasks, people often check them by re-verifying steps to avoid some mistakes. In this paper, we propose and prove that LLMs also have similar self-verification abilities. We take the conclusion obtained by CoT as one of the conditions for solving the original problem. By taking turns masking the original conditions and predicting their results, we calculate an explainable answer verification score based on whether the re-predicted conditions are correct. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the reasoning performance on various arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning datasets.

However, these results rely heavily on delicate prompt design and large computation. In this work, we explore whether the strong zero-shot ability could be achieved at a smaller model scale without any external supervised data. To achieve this goal, we revisit masked language modeling and present a geometry-guided self-supervised learning method (Go-tuningfor short) by taking a small number of task-aware self-supervised data to update language models further. Experiments show that Go-tuning can enable T5-small (80M) competitive zero-shot results compared with large language models, such as T5-XL (3B). We also apply Go-tuning on multi-task settings and develop a multi-task model, mgo-T5 (250M). It can reach the average performance of OPT (175B) on 9 datasets.

Language Models Implicitly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers,Accepted to ACL 2023 findings,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large pretrained language models have shown surprising in-context learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, its working mechanism still remains an open question. In this paper, we explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand in-context learning as implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. We comprehensively compare the behaviors of in-context learning and explicit finetuning on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. Experimental results show that in-context learning behaves similarly to explicit finetuning from multiple perspectives. Inspired by the dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with gradient descent with momentum. The improved performance over vanilla attention further supports our understanding from another perspective, and more importantly, shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model design.

  with arXiv:2204.09714",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Biological systems in nature have evolved for millions of years to adapt and survive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a specific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of designing light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.

Although several effective methods for this problem, topic-to-essay generation, have appeared recently, there is still much room for improvement, especially in terms of the coverage of the given topics and the coherence of the generated text. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TegFormer which utilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with domain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale pre-trained language model. Specifically, a \emph{Topic-Extension} layer capturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific contexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually concise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related semantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation. Moreover, an \emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific word embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word embeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is integrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains a lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to produce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown that the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and higher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according to automatic and human evaluations. As revealed by ablation studies, both the Topic-Extension layer and the Embedding-Fusion module contribute substantially to TegFormer's performance advantage.

Because the diagram mainly consists of simple lines and color blocks, its visual features are sparser than those of natural images. In addition, diagrams usually express diverse knowledge, in which there are many low-frequency object categories in diagrams. These lead to the fact that traditional data-driven detection model is not suitable for diagrams. In this work, we propose a gestalt-perception transformer model for diagram object detection, which is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. Gestalt perception contains a series of laws to explain human perception, that the human visual system tends to perceive patches in an image that are similar, close or connected without abrupt directional changes as a perceptual whole object. Inspired by these thoughts, we build a gestalt-perception graph in transformer encoder, which is composed of diagram patches as nodes and the relationships between patches as edges. This graph aims to group these patches into objects via laws of similarity, proximity, and smoothness implied in these edges, so that the meaningful objects can be effectively detected. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GPTR achieves the best results in the diagram object detection task. Our model also obtains comparable results over the competitors in natural image object detection.

Such research gains increasing attention with the proliferation of social media contents. The conventional framework of handling stance detection is converting it into text classification tasks. Deep learning models have already replaced rule-based models and traditional machine learning models in solving such problems. Current deep neural networks are facing two main challenges which are insufficient labeled data and information in social media posts and the unexplainable nature of deep learning models. A new pre-trained language model chatGPT was launched on Nov 30, 2022. For the stance detection tasks, our experiments show that ChatGPT can achieve SOTA or similar performance for commonly used datasets including SemEval-2016 and P-Stance. At the same time, ChatGPT can provide explanation for its own prediction, which is beyond the capability of any existing model. The explanations for the cases it cannot provide classification results are especially useful. ChatGPT has the potential to be the best AI model for stance detection tasks in NLP, or at least change the research paradigm of this field.

  submissions)",,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Most existing text-video retrieval methods focus on cross-modal matching between the visual content of videos and textual query sentences. However, in real-world scenarios, online videos are often accompanied by relevant text information such as titles, tags, and even subtitles, which can be utilized to match textual queries. This insight has motivated us to propose a novel approach to text-video retrieval, where we directly generate associated captions from videos using zero-shot video captioning with knowledge from web-scale pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP and GPT-2). Given the generated captions, a natural question arises: what benefits do they bring to text-video retrieval? To answer this, we introduce Cap4Video, a new framework that leverages captions in three ways: i) Input data: video-caption pairs can augment the training data. ii) Intermediate feature interaction: we perform cross-modal feature interaction between the video and caption to produce enhanced video representations. iii) Output score: the Query-Caption matching branch can complement the original Query-Video matching branch for text-video retrieval. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without any post-processing, Cap4Video achieves state-of-the-art performance on four standard text-video retrieval benchmarks: MSR-VTT (51.4%), VATEX (66.6%), MSVD (51.8%), and DiDeMo (52.0%).

Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, demonstration designing strategies, as well as related analysis. Finally, we discuss the challenges of ICL and provide potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL.

This motivates the need to utilize external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unfortunately, current methods for incorporating external knowledge often require additional training or fine-tuning, which can be costly and may not be feasible for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing approach, rethinking with retrieval (RR), which retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the decomposed reasoning steps obtained from the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sat, 31 Dec 2022 22:35:34 GMT'}]",2023-01-03,"[['He', 'Hangfeng', ''], ['Zhang', 'Hongming', ''], ['Roth', 'Dan', '']]",0,1,2022-12-31,1,3,2,1,0,1,490d8006851b1562cfd9ec1f057471f2868289d1,255372320.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/490d8006851b1562cfd9ec1f057471f2868289d1,arXiv.org,2022.0,58.0,59.0,4.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '7146703', 'name': 'Hangfeng He'}, {'authorId': '2111112132', 'name': 'Hongming Zhang'}, {'authorId': '144590225', 'name': 'D.

However, we empirically find that there is a generalization gap between the student and the teacher in existing methods. In this work, we show that we can leverage multi-task learning in task-agnostic distillation to advance the generalization of the resulted student. In particular, we propose Multi-task Infused Task-agnostic Knowledge Distillation (MITKD). We first enhance the teacher by multi-task training it on multiple downstream tasks and then perform distillation to produce the student. Experimental results demonstrate that our method yields a student with much better generalization, significantly outperforms existing baselines, and establishes a new state-of-the-art result on in-domain, out-domain, and low-resource datasets in the setting of task-agnostic distillation. Moreover, our method even exceeds an 8x larger BERT$_{\text{Base}}$ on SQuAD and four GLUE tasks.

ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand, people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news, plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of ChatGPT's responses, the differences and gaps from human experts, and future directions for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human evaluations and linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with that of humans, where many interesting results are revealed. After that, we conduct extensive experiments on how to effectively detect whether a certain text is generated by ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection systems, explore several key factors that influence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in different scenarios.

We propose batch prompting, a simple alternative prompting approach that enables the LLM to run inference in batches, instead of one sample at a time. Our method reduces both token and time costs while retaining downstream performance. We theoretically demonstrate that under a few-shot in-context learning setting, the inference costs decrease almost inverse linearly with the number of samples in each batch. We extensively validate the effectiveness of batch prompting on ten datasets across commonsense QA, arithmetic reasoning, and NLI/NLU: batch prompting significantly~(up to $5\times$ with six samples in batch) reduces the LLM (Codex) inference token and time costs while achieving better or comparable performance. Our analysis shows that the number of samples in each batch and the complexity of tasks affect its performance. Further, batch prompting can be applied across different LLMs and reasoning methods.

We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well and show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind significantly on low-resource or distant languages. For distant languages, we explore an interesting strategy named $\mathbf{pivot~prompting}$ that asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot language before into the target language, which improves the translation performance significantly. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but exhibits good results on spoken language. With the launch of the GPT-4 engine, the translation performance of ChatGPT is significantly boosted, becoming comparable to commercial translation products, even for distant languages.

  Zhou",SuperScaler: Supporting Flexible DNN Parallelization via a Unified Abstraction,,,,,cs.DC cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  With the growing model size, deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly trained over massive GPU accelerators, which demands a proper parallelization plan that transforms a DNN model into fine-grained tasks and then schedules them to GPUs for execution. Due to the large search space, the contemporary parallelization plan generators often rely on empirical rules that couple transformation and scheduling, and fall short in exploring more flexible schedules that yield better memory usage and compute efficiency. This tension can be exacerbated by the emerging models with increasing complexity in their structure and model size. SuperScaler is a system that facilitates the design and generation of highly flexible parallelization plans. It formulates the plan design and generation into three sequential phases explicitly: model transformation, space-time scheduling, and data dependency preserving. Such a principled approach decouples multiple seemingly intertwined factors and enables the composition of highly flexible parallelization plans. As a result, SuperScaler can not only generate empirical parallelization plans, but also construct new plans that achieve up to 3.5X speedup compared to state-of-the-art solutions like DeepSpeed, Megatron and Alpa, for emerging DNN models like Swin-Transformer and AlphaFold2, as well as well-optimized models like GPT-3.

Prevailing match-based CEMs (e.g., BLEU, Accuracy, and CodeBLEU) suffer from two significant drawbacks. 1. They primarily measure the surface differences between codes without considering their functional equivalence. However, functional equivalence is pivotal in evaluating the effectiveness of code generation, as different codes can perform identical operations. 2. They are predominantly designed for the Ref-only input format. However, code evaluation necessitates versatility in input formats. Aside from Ref-only, there are NL-only and Ref\&NL formats, which existing match-based CEMs cannot effectively accommodate. In this paper, we propose CodeScore, a large language model (LLM)-based CEM, which estimates the functional correctness of generated code on three input types. To acquire CodeScore, we present UniCE, a unified code generation learning framework, for LLMs to learn code execution (i.e., learning PassRatio and Executability of generated code) with unified input. Extensive experimental results on multiple code evaluation datasets demonstrate that CodeScore absolutely improves up to 58.87% correlation with functional correctness compared to other CEMs, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and effectively handles three input formats.

Although there have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems using large language models (LLMs) and growth in available dialog corpora, dialog tutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper, we rigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring datasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to understand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the challenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real educational settings. We find that although current approaches can model tutoring in constrained learning scenarios when the number of concepts to be taught and possible teacher strategies are small, they perform poorly in less constrained scenarios. Our human quality evaluation shows that both models and ground-truth annotations exhibit low performance in terms of equitable tutoring, which measures learning opportunities for students and how engaging the dialog is.

In these environments, an agent makes compound actions consisting of multiple sub-actions. PPO uses clipping to restrict policy updates. Although clipping is simple and effective, it is not efficient in its sample use. For compound actions, most PPO implementations consider the joint probability (density) of sub-actions, which means that if the ratio of a sample (state compound-action pair) exceeds the range, the gradient the sample produces is zero. Instead, for each sub-action we calculate the loss separately, which is less prone to clipping during updates thereby making better use of samples. Further, we propose a multi-action mixed loss that combines joint and separate probabilities. We perform experiments in Gym-$\mu$RTS and MuJoCo. Our hybrid model improves performance by more than 50\% in different MuJoCo environments compared to OpenAI's PPO benchmark results. And in Gym-$\mu$RTS, we find the sub-action loss outperforms the standard PPO approach, especially when the clip range is large. Our findings suggest this method can better balance the use-efficiency and quality of samples.

To validate the performance of these models, multiple existing benchmarks (e.g., AiXBench and HumanEval) are proposed, including only cases of generating a standalone function, i.e., a function that invokes or accesses only built-in functions and standard libraries. However, standalone functions constitute only about 30\% of functions from real open-source projects. To assess a model's performance for pragmatic code generation (i.e., code generation for real settings of open source or proprietary code), in this paper, we propose a benchmark named CoderEval of pragmatic code generation with generative pre-trained models. Compared with the widely-used HumanEval benchmark from OpenAI, CoderEval can be used to assess the performance of models against pragmatic code generation beyond just generating standalone functions. Through the evaluation of three public available models (CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and Codex) on CoderEval, we analyze and discuss the current progress and future directions of pragmatic code generation with a generative pre-trained model.

We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn ""prompt engineering"" fashion.

Recently, the debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate high-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based on subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g., arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific tasks such as sequence tagging.

For example, a large dialog LLM like ChatGPT has successfully passed part of the US medical licensing exam. However, LLMs currently have difficulty processing images, making it challenging to interpret information from medical images, which are rich in information that supports clinical decisions. On the other hand, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) networks for medical images have seen significant success in the medical field by using advanced deep-learning algorithms to support clinical decision-making. This paper presents a method for integrating LLMs into medical-image CAD networks. The proposed framework uses LLMs to enhance the output of multiple CAD networks, such as diagnosis networks, lesion segmentation networks, and report generation networks, by summarizing and reorganizing the information presented in natural language text format. The goal is to merge the strengths of LLMs' medical domain knowledge and logical reasoning with the vision understanding capability of existing medical-image CAD models to create a more user-friendly and understandable system for patients compared to conventional CAD systems. In the future, LLM's medical knowledge can be also used to improve the performance of vision-based medical-image CAD models.

[Method] We investigate several effective strategies and choose their best combination setting as the training recipes. As for model structure, we employ the vanilla Transformer with disentangled attention as the basic block encoder. For self-supervised training, we employ the representative denoising objective (i.e., replaced token detection) in phase 1 and combine the contrastive objective (i.e., sentence embedding contrastive learning) with it in phase 2. During fine-tuning, several advanced techniques such as transductive fine-tuning, self-calibrated fine-tuning, and adversarial fine-tuning are adopted. [Results] According to our submission record (Jan. 2022), with our optimized pretraining and fine-tuning strategies, our 1.3 billion model sets new state-of-the-art on 4/9 tasks, achieving the best average score of 91.3. Encouragingly, our Vega v1 is the first to exceed powerful human performance on the two challenging tasks, i.e., SST-2 and WNLI.

A PFM (e.g., BERT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) is trained on large-scale data which provides a reasonable parameter initialization for a wide range of downstream applications. BERT learns bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers, which are trained on large datasets as contextual language models. Similarly, the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) method employs Transformers as the feature extractor and is trained using an autoregressive paradigm on large datasets. Recently, ChatGPT shows promising success on large language models, which applies an autoregressive language model with zero shot or few shot prompting. The remarkable achievements of PFM have brought significant breakthroughs to various fields of AI. Numerous studies have proposed different methods, raising the demand for an updated survey. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advancements, challenges, and opportunities for PFMs in text, image, graph, as well as other data modalities. The review covers the basic components and existing pretraining methods used in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning. Additionally, it explores advanced PFMs used for different data modalities and unified PFMs that consider data quality and quantity.

It is challenging due to involving little human intervention. Challenging but worthwhile, zero-shot IE reduces the time and effort that data labeling takes. Recent efforts on large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-3, ChatGPT) show promising performance on zero-shot settings, thus inspiring us to explore prompt-based methods. In this work, we ask whether strong IE models can be constructed by directly prompting LLMs. Specifically, we transform the zero-shot IE task into a multi-turn question-answering problem with a two-stage framework (ChatIE). With the power of ChatGPT, we extensively evaluate our framework on three IE tasks: entity-relation triple extract, named entity recognition, and event extraction. Empirical results on six datasets across two languages show that ChatIE achieves impressive performance and even surpasses some full-shot models on several datasets (e.g., NYT11-HRL).

A set of controlled experiments are conducted based on this framework, providing strong evidence that two probed pre-trained language models (PLMs), T5 and GPT2, have the abstraction capability. We also conduct in-depth analysis, thus shedding further light: (1) the whole training phase exhibits a ""memorize-then-abstract"" two-stage process; (2) the learned abstract concepts are gathered in a few middle-layer attention heads, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the model; (3) the probed abstraction capabilities exhibit robustness against concept mutations, and are more robust to low-level/source-side mutations than high-level/target-side ones; (4) generic pre-training is critical to the emergence of abstraction capability, and PLMs exhibit better abstraction with larger model sizes and data scales.

While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance to unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the AdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart review and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation. We select several popular foundation models as baselines. Results show that ChatGPT shows consistent advantages on most adversarial and OOD classification and translation tasks. However, the absolute performance is far from perfection, which suggests that adversarial and OOD robustness remains a significant threat to foundation models. Moreover, ChatGPT shows astounding performance in understanding dialogue-related texts and we find that it tends to provide informal suggestions for medical tasks instead of definitive answers. Finally, we present in-depth discussions of possible research directions.

It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answer tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful ones to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art on eight complex reasoning tasks.

  C. Wallace",CHiLL: Zero-shot Custom Interpretable Feature Extraction from Clinical Notes with Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded fast and dramatic progress in NLP, and now offer strong few- and zero-shot capabilities on new tasks, reducing the need for annotation. This is especially exciting for the medical domain, in which supervision is often scant and expensive. At the same time, model predictions are rarely so accurate that they can be trusted blindly. Clinicians therefore tend to favor ""interpretable"" classifiers over opaque LLMs. For example, risk prediction tools are often linear models defined over manually crafted predictors that must be laboriously extracted from EHRs. We propose CHiLL (Crafting High-Level Latents), which uses LLMs to permit natural language specification of high-level features for linear models via zero-shot feature extraction using expert-composed queries. This approach has the promise to empower physicians to use their domain expertise to craft features which are clinically meaningful for a downstream task of interest, without having to manually extract these from raw EHR (as often done now). We are motivated by a real-world risk prediction task, but as a reproducible proxy, we use MIMIC-III and MIMIC-CXR data and standard predictive tasks (e.g., 30-day readmission) to evaluate our approach. We find that linear models using automatically extracted features are comparably performant to models using reference features, and provide greater interpretability than linear models using ""Bag-of-Words"" features. We verify that learned feature weights align well with clinical expectations.

However, most CoT studies rely on carefully designed human-annotated rational chains to prompt the language model, which poses challenges for real-world applications where labeled training data is available without human-annotated rational chains. This creates barriers to applications of CoT prompting to these general tasks. This paper proposes a new strategy, Automate-CoT (Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought), that can bypass human engineering of CoTs by automatically augmenting rational chains from a small labeled dataset, and then pruning low-quality chains to construct a candidate pool of machine-generated rationale chains based on the labels. Finally, it selects the optimal combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting by employing a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to estimate the significance of each example in a black-box language model. Automate-CoT enables a quick adaptation of the CoT technique to different tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where state-of-the-art results are achieved on arithmetic reasoning (+2.7\%), commonsense reasoning (+3.4\%), symbolic reasoning (+3.2\%), and non-reasoning tasks (+2.5\%).

However, pretrained on large-scale natural language corpora, the generated text from PLMs may exhibit social bias against disadvantaged demographic groups. To improve the fairness of PLMs in text generation, we propose to minimize the mutual information between the semantics in the generated text sentences and their demographic polarity, i.e., the demographic group to which the sentence is referring. In this way, the mentioning of a demographic group (e.g., male or female) is encouraged to be independent from how it is described in the generated text, thus effectively alleviating the social bias. Moreover, we propose to efficiently estimate the upper bound of the above mutual information via importance sampling, leveraging a natural language corpus. We also propose a distillation mechanism that preserves the language modeling ability of the PLMs after debiasing. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior performance in term of both fairness and language modeling ability.

Safe robot reinforcement learning (SRRL) is a crucial step towards achieving human-robot coexistence. In this paper, we envision a human-centered SRRL framework consisting of three stages: safe exploration, safety value alignment, and safe collaboration. We examine the research gaps in these areas and propose to leverage interactive behaviors for SRRL. Interactive behaviors enable bi-directional information transfer between humans and robots, such as conversational robot ChatGPT. We argue that interactive behaviors need further attention from the SRRL community. We discuss four open challenges related to the robustness, efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of SRRL with interactive behaviors.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

  ICLR'23",ICLR 2023,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  With adversarial or otherwise normal prompts, existing large language models (LLM) can be pushed to generate toxic discourses. One way to reduce the risk of LLMs generating undesired discourses is to alter the training of the LLM. This can be very restrictive due to demanding computation requirements. Other methods rely on rule-based or prompt-based token elimination, which are limited as they dismiss future tokens and the overall meaning of the complete discourse. Here, we center detoxification on the probability that the finished discourse is ultimately considered toxic. That is, at each point, we advise against token selections proportional to how likely a finished text from this point will be toxic. To this end, we formally extend the dead-end theory from the recent reinforcement learning (RL) literature to also cover uncertain outcomes. Our approach, called rectification, utilizes a separate but significantly smaller model for detoxification, which can be applied to diverse LLMs as long as they share the same vocabulary. Importantly, our method does not require access to the internal representations of the LLM, but only the token probability distribution at each decoding step. This is crucial as many LLMs today are hosted in servers and only accessible through APIs. When applied to various LLMs, including GPT-3, our approach significantly improves the generated discourse compared to the base LLMs and other techniques in terms of both the overall language and detoxification performance.

Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, ChatGPT and GPT-4, has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However, it is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS. In this report, we empirically use various prompts to guide LLMs to perform zero-shot CLS from different paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminary evaluation on the generated summaries. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 originally prefer to produce lengthy summaries with detailed information. These two LLMs can further balance informativeness and conciseness with the help of an interactive prompt, significantly improving their CLS performance. Experimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot CLS performance, and performs competitively compared with the fine-tuned mBART-50. Moreover, we also find some multi-lingual and bilingual LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, ChatGLM-6B, Vicuna-13B and ChatYuan) have limited zero-shot CLS ability. Due to the composite nature of CLS, which requires models to perform summarization and translation simultaneously, accomplishing this task in a zero-shot manner is even a challenge for LLMs. Therefore, we sincerely hope and recommend future LLM research could use CLS as a testbed.

However, their robustness and abilities to handle various complexities of the open world have yet to be explored, which is especially crucial in assessing the stability of models and is a key aspect of trustworthy AI. In this study, we perform a comprehensive experimental analysis of GPT-3.5, exploring its robustness using 21 datasets (about 116K test samples) with 66 text transformations from TextFlint that cover 9 popular Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. Our findings indicate that while GPT-3.5 outperforms existing fine-tuned models on some tasks, it still encounters significant robustness degradation, such as its average performance dropping by up to 35.74\% and 43.59\% in natural language inference and sentiment analysis tasks, respectively.

However, for many questions, they may produce false answers that look accurate. How do we train the model to precisely understand the concepts? In this paper, we introduce succinct representations of concepts based on category theory. Such representation yields concept-wise invariance properties under various tasks, resulting a new learning algorithm that can provably and accurately learn complex concepts or fix misconceptions. Moreover, by recursively expanding the succinct representations, one can generate a hierarchical decomposition, and manually verify the concept by individually examining each part inside the decomposition.

Many products and services in Tencent Inc., such as WeChat, QQ, and Tencent Advertisement, have been opted in to gain the power of pre-trained models. In this work, we present Angel-PTM, a productive deep learning system designed for pre-training and fine-tuning Transformer models. Angel-PTM can train extremely large-scale models with hierarchical memory efficiently. The key designs of Angel-PTM are the fine-grained memory management via the Page abstraction and a unified scheduling method that coordinate the computations, data movements, and communications. Furthermore, Angel-PTM supports extreme model scaling with SSD storage and implements the lock-free updating mechanism to address the SSD I/O bandwidth bottlenecks. Experimental results demonstrate that Angel-PTM outperforms existing systems by up to 114.8% in terms of maximum model scale as well as up to 88.9% in terms of training throughput. Additionally, experiments on GPT3-175B and T5-MoE-1.2T models utilizing hundreds of GPUs verify the strong scalability of Angel-PTM.

  Qiao, Zhiyong Wu",OpenICL: An Open-Source Framework for In-context Learning,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In recent years, In-context Learning (ICL) has gained increasing attention and emerged as the new paradigm for large language model (LLM) evaluation. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, ICL instead adapts the pre-trained models to unseen tasks without any parameter updates. However, the implementation of ICL is sophisticated due to the diverse retrieval and inference methods involved, as well as the varying pre-processing requirements for different models, datasets, and tasks. A unified and flexible framework for ICL is urgently needed to ease the implementation of the aforementioned components. To facilitate ICL research, we introduce OpenICL, an open-source toolkit for ICL and LLM evaluation. OpenICL is research-friendly with a highly flexible architecture that users can easily combine different components to suit their needs. It also provides various state-of-the-art retrieval and inference methods to streamline the process of adapting ICL to cutting-edge research. The effectiveness of OpenICL has been validated on a wide range of NLP tasks, including classification, QA, machine translation, and semantic parsing. As a side-product, we found OpenICL to be an efficient yet robust tool for LLMs evaluation.

  https://github.com/dhg-wei/DeCap",,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer capability in many discriminative tasks. Their adaptation to zero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training, easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs. The modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps.

This problem is common in real-world applications, particularly in cases where the function is assessed by human judges. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a prominent example of such an application, which is adopted by the recent works \cite{ouyang2022training,liu2023languages,chatgpt,bai2022training} to improve the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human guidance. We propose ZO-RankSGD, a first-of-its-kind zeroth-order optimization algorithm, to solve this optimization problem with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, our algorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction and is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be directly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when only a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD a promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online fashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers an effective approach for aligning human and machine intentions in a wide range of domains.

2303.03836,Jun Gao,"Jun Gao, Huan Zhao, Changlong Yu, Ruifeng Xu",Exploring the Feasibility of ChatGPT for Event Extraction,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Event extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and extracting information about events mentioned in text. However, it is a challenging task due to the lack of annotated data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT provides an opportunity to solve language tasks with simple prompts without the need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning. While ChatGPT has demonstrated impressive results in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering, it presents challenges when used for complex tasks like event extraction. Unlike other tasks, event extraction requires the model to be provided with a complex set of instructions defining all event types and their schemas. To explore the feasibility of ChatGPT for event extraction and the challenges it poses, we conducted a series of experiments. Our results show that ChatGPT has, on average, only 51.04% of the performance of a task-specific model such as EEQA in long-tail and complex scenarios. Our usability testing experiments indicate that ChatGPT is not robust enough, and continuous refinement of the prompt does not lead to stable performance improvements, which can result in a poor user experience. Besides, ChatGPT is highly sensitive to different prompt styles.

A Preliminary Study,"Technical Report, 11 pages",,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT achieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation metric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of natural language generation (NLG) models is an arduous task and NLG metrics notoriously show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to evaluate the generated results of NLG models. We conduct experiments on five NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation with human judgments in most cases. In addition, we find that the effectiveness of the ChatGPT evaluator might be influenced by the creation method of the meta-evaluation datasets. For the meta-evaluation datasets which are created greatly depending on the reference and thus are biased, the ChatGPT evaluator might lose its effectiveness. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the emergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric.

However, since ChatGPT is trained with languages, it is currently not capable of processing or generating images from the visual world. At the same time, Visual Foundation Models, such as Visual Transformers or Stable Diffusion, although showing great visual understanding and generation capabilities, they are only experts on specific tasks with one-round fixed inputs and outputs. To this end, We build a system called \textbf{Visual ChatGPT}, incorporating different Visual Foundation Models, to enable the user to interact with ChatGPT by 1) sending and receiving not only languages but also images 2) providing complex visual questions or visual editing instructions that require the collaboration of multiple AI models with multi-steps. 3) providing feedback and asking for corrected results. We design a series of prompts to inject the visual model information into ChatGPT, considering models of multiple inputs/outputs and models that require visual feedback. Experiments show that Visual ChatGPT opens the door to investigating the visual roles of ChatGPT with the help of Visual Foundation Models.

It reformulates the downstream tasks as the generative pre-training ones, thus narrowing down the gap between them and improving the performance stably. However, when transferring it to the vision area, current visual prompt learning methods are all designed on discriminative pre-trained models, and there is also a lack of careful design to unify the forms of pre-training and downstream tasks. To explore prompt learning on the generative pre-trained visual model as well as keeping the task consistency, we propose Visual Prompt learning as masked visual Token Modeling (VPTM) to transform the downstream visual classification into the pre-trained masked visual token prediction. In addition, we develop the prototypical verbalizer for mapping the predicted visual token with implicit semantics to explicit downstream labels. To our best knowledge, VPTM is the first visual prompt method on the generative pre-trained visual model, and the first to achieve consistency between pre-training and downstream visual classification by task reformulation. Experiments show that VPTM outperforms other visual prompt methods and achieves excellent efficiency. Moreover, the task consistency of VPTM contributes to the robustness against prompt location, prompt length and prototype dimension, and could be deployed uniformly.

Despite their successes in NLP tasks, no investigation has been conducted to assess the ability of LLMs to perform document information extraction (DIE) using in-context learning. Applying LLMs to DIE poses two challenges: the modality and task gap. To this end, we propose a simple but effective in-context learning framework called ICL-D3IE, which enables LLMs to perform DIE with different types of demonstration examples. Specifically, we extract the most difficult and distinct segments from hard training documents as hard demonstrations for benefiting all test instances. We design demonstrations describing relationships that enable LLMs to understand positional relationships. We introduce formatting demonstrations for easy answer extraction. Additionally, the framework improves diverse demonstrations by updating them iteratively. Our experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the ICL-D3IE framework enables Davinci-003/ChatGPT to achieve superior performance when compared to previous pre-trained methods fine-tuned with full training in both the in-distribution (ID) setting and in the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting.

Recently, many approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend method names and detect inconsistent names. Despite promising, their results are still sub-optimal considering the three following drawbacks: 1) These models are mostly trained from scratch, learning two different objectives simultaneously. The misalignment between two objectives will negatively affect training efficiency and model performance. 2) The enclosing class context is not fully exploited, making it difficult to learn the abstract function of the method. 3) Current method name consistency checking methods follow a generate-then-compare process, which restricts the accuracy as they highly rely on the quality of generated names and face difficulty measuring the semantic consistency.   In this paper, we propose an approach named AUMENA to AUtomate MEthod NAming tasks with context-aware prompt-tuning. Unlike existing deep learning based approaches, our model first learns the contextualized representation(i.e., class attributes) of PL and NL through the pre-training model, then fully exploits the capacity and knowledge of large language model with prompt-tuning to precisely detect inconsistent method names and recommend more accurate names. To better identify semantically consistent names, we model the method name consistency checking task as a two-class classification problem, avoiding the limitation of previous similarity-based consistency checking approaches. The experimental results reflect that AUMENA scores 68.6%, 72.0%, 73.6%, 84.7% on four datasets of method name recommendation, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by 8.5%, 18.4%, 11.0%, 12.0%, respectively. And our approach scores 80.8% accuracy on method name consistency checking, reaching an 5.5% outperformance. All data and trained models are publicly available.

However, the academia community lacks a dataset that can validate the multimodal generation capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in textual-visual chat tasks. In this paper, we construct two new multimodal datasets: the synthetic CLEVR-ATVC dataset (620K) and the manually pictured Fruit-ATVC dataset (50K), both featuring visual and text-based inputs and outputs. Additionally, to enable the multimodal system to reject human requests (i.e., demonstrate accountability), as in language-based ChatGPT conversations, we develop and incorporate specific rules into the datasets as supervisory signals. This allows the trained VLM to provide a yes or no answer after visual and textual reasoning, accompanied by a language explanation as to why the human instruction cannot be excuted. In our method, we propose a two-state training procedure to train the image auto-encoder and auto-regressive transformer from scratch. The first state involves a discrete variational autoencoder (dVAE) to compress each image into short tokens, which are then concatenated with text tokens as a single data stream to be fed into the decoder-based transformer for generating visual re-creation and textual feedback in the second state. We provide comprehensive analyses of experimental results in terms of re-created image quality, answer accuracy, and the model behavior when faced with uncertainty and imperfect user queries.

Till now, various kinds of control signals for CIC have been proposed, ranging from content-related control to structure-related control. However, due to the format and target gaps of different control signals, all existing CIC works (or architectures) only focus on one certain control signal, and overlook the human-like combinatorial ability. By ``combinatorial"", we mean that our humans can easily meet multiple needs (or constraints) simultaneously when generating descriptions. To this end, we propose a novel prompt-based framework for CIC by learning Combinatorial Prompts, dubbed as ComPro. Specifically, we directly utilize a pretrained language model GPT-2 as our language model, which can help to bridge the gap between different signal-specific CIC architectures. Then, we reformulate the CIC as a prompt-guide sentence generation problem, and propose a new lightweight prompt generation network to generate the combinatorial prompts for different kinds of control signals. For different control signals, we further design a new mask attention mechanism to realize the prompt-based CIC. Due to its simplicity, our ComPro can be further extended to more kinds of combined control signals by concatenating these prompts. Extensive experiments on two prevalent CIC benchmarks have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our ComPro on both single and combined control signals.

This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large language models have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose InferFix: a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs. InferFix combines a Retriever -- transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator -- a large language model (Codex Cushman) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated InferredBugs, a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that InferFix outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java. We discuss the deployment of InferFix alongside Infer at Microsoft which offers an end-to-end solution for detection, classification, and localization of bugs, as well as fixing and validation of candidate patches, integrated in the continuous integration pipeline to automate the software development workflow.

Cognitive scientists have devised many experiments that probe, and have made great progress in explaining, how people process language. We subjected ChatGPT to 12 of these experiments, pre-registered and with 1,000 runs per experiment. In 10 of them, ChatGPT replicated the human pattern of language use. It associated unfamiliar words with different meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures, reinterpreted implausible sentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, glossed over errors, drew reasonable inferences, associated causality with different discourse entities according to verb semantics, and accessed different meanings and retrieved different words depending on the identity of its interlocutor. However, unlike humans, it did not prefer using shorter words to convey less informative content and it did not use context to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities. We discuss how these convergences and divergences may occur in the transformer architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT are capable of mimicking human language processing to a great extent, and that they have the potential to provide insights into how people learn and use language.

These models have also made a significant impact in the field of law, where they are being increasingly utilized to automate various legal tasks, such as legal judgement prediction, legal document analysis, and legal document writing. However, the integration of LLMs into the legal field has also raised several legal problems, including privacy concerns, bias, and explainability. In this survey, we explore the integration of LLMs into the field of law. We discuss the various applications of LLMs in legal tasks, examine the legal challenges that arise from their use, and explore the data resources that can be used to specialize LLMs in the legal domain.

Our method achieves more fine-grained compression of the whole transformer, including embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU, softmax, layer normalization, and all the intermediate results.

We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin.

This paper shows that the networks in diffusion models, namely denoising diffusion autoencoders (DDAE), are unified self-supervised learners: by pre-training on unconditional image generation, DDAE has already learned strongly linear-separable representations within its intermediate layers without auxiliary encoders, thus making diffusion pre-training emerge as a general approach for generative-and-discriminative dual learning. To validate this, we conduct linear probe and fine-tuning evaluations. Our diffusion-based approach achieves 95.9% and 50.0% linear evaluation accuracies on CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, and is comparable to contrastive learning and masked autoencoders for the first time. Transfer learning from ImageNet also confirms the suitability of DDAE for Vision Transformers, suggesting the potential to scale DDAEs as unified foundation models.

As popular generative pre-training, diffusion models capture both low-level visual knowledge and high-level semantic relations. In this paper, we propose to exploit such knowledgeable diffusion models for mainstream discriminative tasks, i.e., unsupervised object discovery: saliency segmentation and object localization. However, the challenges exist as there is one structural difference between generative and discriminative models, which limits the direct use. Besides, the lack of explicitly labeled data significantly limits performance in unsupervised settings. To tackle these issues, we introduce DiffusionSeg, one novel synthesis-exploitation framework containing two-stage strategies. To alleviate data insufficiency, we synthesize abundant images, and propose a novel training-free AttentionCut to obtain masks in the first synthesis stage. In the second exploitation stage, to bridge the structural gap, we use the inversion technique, to map the given image back to diffusion features. These features can be directly used by downstream architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of adapting diffusion for unsupervised object discovery.

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability.

However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%.

With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle. In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward answering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and self-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and creativity content. Finally, we discuss the challenges currently faced and present an outlook on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

Consequently, this study compared the writing performance on a narrative topic by ChatGPT and Chinese intermediate English (CIE) learners so as to reveal the chatbot's advantage and disadvantage in writing. The data were analyzed in terms of five discourse components using Coh-Metrix (a special instrument for analyzing language discourses), and the results revealed that ChatGPT performed better than human writers in narrativity, word concreteness, and referential cohesion, but worse in syntactic simplicity and deep cohesion in its initial version. After more revision commands were updated, while the resulting version was facilitated in syntactic simplicity, yet it is still lagged far behind CIE learners' writing in deep cohesion. In addition, the correlation analysis of the discourse components suggests that narrativity was correlated with referential cohesion in both ChatGPT and human writers, but the correlations varied within each group.

Developing effective techniques to process and understand legal documents is extremely useful in resolving this problem. In this paper, we present our systems for SemEval-2023 Task 6: understanding legal texts (Modi et al., 2023). Specifically, we first develop the Legal-BERT-HSLN model that considers the comprehensive context information in both intra- and inter-sentence levels to predict rhetorical roles (subtask A) and then train a Legal-LUKE model, which is legal-contextualized and entity-aware, to recognize legal entities (subtask B). Our evaluations demonstrate that our designed models are more accurate than baselines, e.g., with an up to 15.0% better F1 score in subtask B. We achieved notable performance in the task leaderboard, e.g., 0.834 micro F1 score, and ranked No.5 out of 27 teams in subtask A.

To demonstrate its capabilities as a keyphrase generator, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for the keyphrase generation task. We evaluate its performance in various aspects, including keyphrase generation prompts, keyphrase generation diversity, multi-domain keyphrase generation, and long document understanding. Our evaluation is based on six benchmark datasets, and we adopt the prompt suggested by OpenAI while extending it to six candidate prompts. We find that ChatGPT performs exceptionally well on all six candidate prompts, with minor performance differences observed across the datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude that ChatGPT has great potential for keyphrase generation. Moreover, we discover that ChatGPT still faces challenges when it comes to generating absent keyphrases.

Although deep learning-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they often overlook the rich semantic information present in the text, leading to less expressive and meaningful gestures. We propose GesGPT, a novel approach to gesture generation that leverages the semantic analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT. By capitalizing on the strengths of LLMs for text analysis, we design prompts to extract gesture-related information from textual input. Our method entails developing prompt principles that transform gesture generation into an intention classification problem based on GPT, and utilizing a curated gesture library and integration module to produce semantically rich co-speech gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that GesGPT effectively generates contextually appropriate and expressive gestures, offering a new perspective on semantic co-speech gesture generation.

However, prior research has shown that in-context learning can suffer from high instability due to variations in training examples, example order, and prompt formats. Therefore, the construction of an appropriate prompt is essential for improving the performance of in-context learning. In this paper, we revisit this problem from the view of predictive bias. Specifically, we introduce a metric to evaluate the predictive bias of a fixed prompt against labels or a given attributes. Then we empirically show that prompts with higher bias always lead to unsatisfactory predictive quality. Based on this observation, we propose a novel search strategy based on the greedy search to identify the near-optimal prompt for improving the performance of in-context learning. We perform comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art mainstream models such as GPT-3 on various downstream tasks. Our results indicate that our method can enhance the model's in-context learning performance in an effective and interpretable manner.

We inspect the outputs and find that ChatGPT goes beyond one-by-one corrections. Specifically, it prefers to change the surface expression of certain phrases or sentence structure while maintaining grammatical correctness. Human evaluation quantitatively confirms this and suggests that ChatGPT produces less under-correction or mis-correction issues but more over-corrections. These results demonstrate that ChatGPT is severely under-estimated by the automatic evaluation metrics and could be a promising tool for GEC.

Recent research has shown that utilizing ChatGPT for assessing the quality of machine translation (MT) achieves state-of-the-art performance at the system level but performs poorly at the segment level. To further improve the performance of LLMs on MT quality assessment, we conducted an investigation into several prompting methods. Our results indicate that by combining Chain-of-Thoughts and Error Analysis, a new prompting method called \textbf{\texttt{Error Analysis Prompting}}, LLMs like ChatGPT can \textit{generate human-like MT evaluations at both the system and segment level}. Additionally, we discovered some limitations of ChatGPT as an MT evaluator, such as unstable scoring and biases when provided with multiple translations in a single query. Our findings aim to provide a preliminary experience for appropriately evaluating translation quality on ChatGPT while offering a variety of tricks in designing prompts for in-context learning. We anticipate that this report will shed new light on advancing the field of translation evaluation with LLMs by enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of metrics.

Project page: https://fantasia3d.github.io/,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Automatic 3D content creation has achieved rapid progress recently due to the availability of pre-trained, large language models and image diffusion models, forming the emerging topic of text-to-3D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods commonly use implicit scene representations, which couple the geometry and appearance via volume rendering and are suboptimal in terms of recovering finer geometries and achieving photorealistic rendering; consequently, they are less effective for generating high-quality 3D assets. In this work, we propose a new method of Fantasia3D for high-quality text-to-3D content creation. Key to Fantasia3D is the disentangled modeling and learning of geometry and appearance. For geometry learning, we rely on a hybrid scene representation, and propose to encode surface normal extracted from the representation as the input of the image diffusion model. For appearance modeling, we introduce the spatially varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) into the text-to-3D task, and learn the surface material for photorealistic rendering of the generated surface. Our disentangled framework is more compatible with popular graphics engines, supporting relighting, editing, and physical simulation of the generated 3D assets. We conduct thorough experiments that show the advantages of our method over existing ones under different text-to-3D task settings. Project page and source codes: https://fantasia3d.github.io/.

Existing backdoor attacking systems face two severe issues:firstly, most backdoor triggers follow a uniform and usually input-independent pattern, e.g., insertion of specific trigger words, synonym replacement. This significantly hinders the stealthiness of the attacking model, leading the trained backdoor model being easily identified as malicious by model probes. Secondly, trigger-inserted poisoned sentences are usually disfluent, ungrammatical, or even change the semantic meaning from the original sentence, making them being easily filtered in the pre-processing stage. To resolve these two issues, in this paper, we propose an input-unique backdoor attack(NURA), where we generate backdoor triggers unique to inputs. IDBA generates context-related triggers by continuing writing the input with a language model like GPT2. The generated sentence is used as the backdoor trigger. This strategy not only creates input-unique backdoor triggers, but also preserves the semantics of the original input, simultaneously resolving the two issues above. Experimental results show that the IDBA attack is effective for attack and difficult to defend: it achieves high attack success rate across all the widely applied benchmarks, while is immune to existing defending methods. In addition, it is able to generate fluent, grammatical, and diverse backdoor inputs, which can hardly be recognized through human inspection.

However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What's more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user's preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task. Chat-Rec offers a novel approach to improving recommender systems and presents new practical scenarios for the implementation of AIGC (AI generated content) in recommender system studies.

Despite the increased efficiency and diversity, the inherent instability of AI models poses a persistent challenge in guiding these models to produce the desired content for users. In this paper, we introduce an integration of wireless perception (WP) with AI-generated content (AIGC) and propose a unified WP-AIGC framework to improve the quality of digital content production. The framework employs a novel multi-scale perception technology to read user's posture, which is difficult to describe accurately in words, and transmits it to the AIGC model as skeleton images. Based on these images and user's service requirements, the AIGC model generates corresponding digital content. Since the production process imposes the user's posture as a constraint on the AIGC model, it makes the generated content more aligned with the user's requirements. Additionally, WP-AIGC can also accept user's feedback, allowing adjustment of computing resources at edge server to improve service quality. Experiments results verify the effectiveness of the WP-AIGC framework, highlighting its potential as a novel approach for guiding AI models in the accurate generation of digital content.

The original goal of Shannon's information theory is to describe and transmit information content. However, due to information is related to cognition, and cognition is considered to be subjective, Shannon information theory is to describe and transmit information-bearing signals. With the development of the information age to the intelligent age, the traditional signal-oriented processing needs to be upgraded to content-oriented processing. For example, chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) has initially realized the content processing capability based on massive data. For many years, researchers have been searching for the answer to what the information content in the signal is, because only when the information content is mathematically and accurately described can information-based machines be truly intelligent. This paper starts from rethinking the essence of the basic concepts of the information, such as semantics, meaning, information and knowledge, presents the mathematical characterization of the information content, investigate the relationship between them, studies the transformation from Shannon's signal information theory to semantic information theory, and therefore proposes a content-oriented semantic communication framework.

The two predominant approaches are Adapters and Pruning. Adapters are to freeze the model and give it a new weight matrix on the side, which can significantly reduce the time and memory of training, but the cost is that the evaluation and testing will increase the time and memory consumption. Pruning is to cut off some weight and re-distribute the remaining weight, which sacrifices the complexity of training at the cost of extremely high memory and training time, making the cost of evaluation and testing relatively low. So efficiency of training and inference can't be obtained in the same time.

Instruction-tuning not only significantly enhances the model's performance and generalization but also makes the model's generated results more consistent with human speech patterns. However current research rarely studies the impact of different amounts of instruction data on model performance, especially in the real-world use cases. In this paper we explore the performance of large language models based on instruction tuning across different scales of instruction data. An evaluation dataset consisting of 12 major online use cases is constructed in the experiment. With Bloomz-7B1-mt as the base model, the results show that 1) merely increasing the amount of instruction data leads to continuous improvement in tasks such as open-ended generation, 2) in tasks such as math and code, the model performance curve remains quite flat while increasing data size. We further analyze the possible causes of these phenomena and propose potential future research directions such as effectively selecting high-quality training data, scaling base models and training methods specialized for hard tasks.

However, current studies of text structuralization suffer from a shortage of manually annotated high-quality datasets from different domains and languages, which require specialized professional knowledge. In addition, most IE methods are designed for a specific type of structured data, e.g., entities, relations, and events, making them hard to generalize to others. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient approach to instruct large language model (LLM) to extract a variety of structures from texts. More concretely, we add a prefix and a suffix instruction to indicate the desired IE task and structure type, respectively, before feeding the text into a LLM. Experiments on two LLMs show that this approach can enable language models to perform comparable with other state-of-the-art methods on datasets of a variety of languages and knowledge, and can generalize to other IE sub-tasks via changing the content of instruction. Another benefit of our approach is that it can help researchers to build datasets in low-source and domain-specific scenarios, e.g., fields in finance and law, with low cost.

The evaluation of the quality of the generated text is a complex problem. A big challenge to language evaluation is that there is a clear divergence between existing metrics and human evaluation. A document summary's quality can be assessed by human annotators on various criteria, both objective ones like grammar and correctness, and subjective ones like informativeness, succinctness, and appeal. Most of the automatic evaluation methods like BLUE/ROUGE may be not able to adequately capture the above dimensions. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework based on LLMs, which provides a comprehensive evaluation framework by comparing generated text and reference text from both objective and subjective aspects. First, we propose to model objective and subjective dimensions of generated text based on roleplayers prompting mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a context-based prompting mechanism that is able to generate dynamic roleplayer profiles based on input context. Finally, we design a multi-roleplayer prompting technology based on batch prompting and integrate multiple outputs into the final evaluation results. Experimental results on three real datasets for summarization show that our model is highly competitive and has a very high consistency with human annotators.

Present-day machine translation tools often fail to accurately translate attributive clauses from Japanese to Chinese. In light of this, this paper investigates the linguistic problem underlying such difficulties, namely how does the semantic role of the modified noun affect the selection of translation patterns for attributive clauses, from a linguistic perspective. To ad-dress these difficulties, a pre-edit scheme is proposed, which aims to enhance the accuracy of translation. Furthermore, we propose a novel two-step prompt strategy, which combines this pre-edit scheme with ChatGPT, currently the most widely used large language model. This prompt strategy is capable of optimizing translation input in zero-shot scenarios and has been demonstrated to improve the average translation accuracy score by over 35%.

Ecosystem Graphs is composed of assets (datasets, models, applications) linked together by dependencies that indicate technical (e.g. how Bing relies on GPT-4) and social (e.g. how Microsoft relies on OpenAI) relationships. To supplement the graph structure, each asset is further enriched with fine-grained metadata (e.g. the license or training emissions). We document the ecosystem extensively at https://crfm.stanford.edu/ecosystem-graphs/. As of March 16, 2023, we annotate 262 assets (64 datasets, 128 models, 70 applications) from 63 organizations linked by 356 dependencies. We show Ecosystem Graphs functions as a powerful abstraction and interface for achieving the minimum transparency required to address myriad use cases. Therefore, we envision Ecosystem Graphs will be a community-maintained resource that provides value to stakeholders spanning AI researchers, industry professionals, social scientists, auditors and policymakers.

Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge.

However, data annotation can be a time-consuming and expensive process, especially when the task involves a large amount of data or requires specialized domains. Recently, GPT-3.5 series models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot and zero-shot ability across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we first claim that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, can serve as an excellent crowdsourced annotator by providing them with sufficient guidance and demonstrated examples. To make LLMs to be better annotators, we propose a two-step approach, 'explain-then-annotate'. To be more precise, we begin by creating prompts for every demonstrated example, which we subsequently utilize to prompt a LLM to provide an explanation for why the specific ground truth answer/label was chosen for that particular example. Following this, we construct the few-shot chain-of-thought prompt with the self-generated explanation and employ it to annotate the unlabeled data. We conduct experiments on three tasks, including user input and keyword relevance assessment, BoolQ and WiC. The annotation results from GPT-3.5 surpasses those from crowdsourced annotation for user input and keyword relevance assessment. Additionally, for the other two tasks, GPT-3.5 achieves results that are comparable to those obtained through crowdsourced annotation.

However, existing methods normally neglect the view cues embedded in the text modality and fail to weigh the relative importance of different views. In this paper, we propose ViewRefer, a multi-view framework for 3D visual grounding exploring how to grasp the view knowledge from both text and 3D modalities. For the text branch, ViewRefer leverages the diverse linguistic knowledge of large-scale language models, e.g., GPT, to expand a single grounding text to multiple geometry-consistent descriptions. Meanwhile, in the 3D modality, a transformer fusion module with inter-view attention is introduced to boost the interaction of objects across views.

  Hershcovich",Assessing Cross-Cultural Alignment between ChatGPT and Human Societies: An Empirical Study,C3NLP@EACL 2023,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The recent release of ChatGPT has garnered widespread recognition for its exceptional ability to generate human-like responses in dialogue. Given its usage by users from various nations and its training on a vast multilingual corpus that incorporates diverse cultural and societal norms, it is crucial to evaluate its effectiveness in cultural adaptation. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cultural background of ChatGPT by analyzing its responses to questions designed to quantify human cultural differences. Our findings suggest that, when prompted with American context, ChatGPT exhibits a strong alignment with American culture, but it adapts less effectively to other cultural contexts. Furthermore, by using different prompts to probe the model, we show that English prompts reduce the variance in model responses, flattening out cultural differences and biasing them towards American culture. This study provides valuable insights into the cultural implications of ChatGPT and highlights the necessity of greater diversity and cultural awareness in language technologies.

However, the problems exposed by software have also come to the fore. Software defect has become an important factor troubling developers. In this context, Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques have emerged, aiming to automatically fix software defect problems and reduce manual debugging work. In particular, benefiting from the advances in deep learning, numerous learning-based APR techniques have emerged in recent years, which also bring new opportunities for APR research. To give researchers a quick overview of APR techniques' complete development and future opportunities, we revisit the evolution of APR techniques and discuss in depth the latest advances in APR research. In this paper, the development of APR techniques is introduced in terms of four different patch generation schemes: search-based, constraint-based, template-based, and learning-based. Moreover, we propose a uniform set of criteria to review and compare each APR tool, summarize the advantages and disadvantages of APR techniques, and discuss the current state of APR development. Furthermore, we introduce the research on the related technical areas of APR that have also provided a strong motivation to advance APR development. Finally, we analyze current challenges and future directions, especially highlighting the critical opportunities that large language models bring to APR research.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance in various tasks. Therefore, we present this paper to investigate the effectiveness of LLMs, especially ChatGPT, and explore ways to optimize their use in assessing text quality. We compared three kinds of reference-free evaluation methods. The experimental results prove that ChatGPT is capable of evaluating text quality effectively from various perspectives without reference and demonstrates superior performance than most existing automatic metrics. In particular, the Explicit Score, which utilizes ChatGPT to generate a numeric score measuring text quality, is the most effective and reliable method among the three exploited approaches. However, directly comparing the quality of two texts may lead to suboptimal results.

Many recent studies have discovered that traditional DNNs usually encode sparse symbolic concepts. However, because an LLM has much more parameters than traditional DNNs, whether the LLM also encodes sparse symbolic concepts is still an open problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to disentangle the inference score of LLMs for dialogue tasks into a small number of symbolic concepts. We verify that we can use those sparse concepts to well estimate all inference scores of the LLM on all arbitrarily masking states of the input sentence. We also evaluate the transferability of concepts encoded by an LLM and verify that symbolic concepts usually exhibit high transferability across similar input sentences. More crucially, those symbolic concepts can be used to explain the exact reasons accountable for the LLM's prediction errors.

This issue can be alleviated through quantization. In this paper, we identify that the challenge in quantizing activations in LLMs arises from varying ranges across channels, rather than solely the presence of outliers. To address this challenge, we introduce a quantization method called RPTQ, which utilizes a reorder-based approach. By rearranging the channels and quantizing them in clusters, RPTQ effectively mitigates the impact of range differences between channels. To minimize the overhead of the reorder operation, we fuse it into the layer norm operation and weights in linear layers. In our experiments, RPTQ achieved a significant breakthrough by utilizing 3-bit activation in LLMs for the first time, resulting in a substantial reduction in memory usage. For instance, quantizing OPT-175b can lead to a memory consumption reduction of up to 80%.

These operations bring the inevitable challenges of massive computation resources and huge memory footprint, usually requiring at least 10^23 FLOPs and hundreds of gigabytes, respectively. A common method to address this issue is to reduce the computational and memory requirements by applying layerwise quantization to the transformer, replacing the usual fp32 data type with a low-bit equivalent. Unfortunately, this method often leads to decreased model accuracy and necessitates time-consuming retraining. Such retraining not only requires fine-tuning skills but also substantial computational resources, posing challenges for users. To specifically tackle these issues, we propose BCT, a framework of blockwise compression for transformers without retraining, aiming to facilitate model deployment. Unlike layerwise compression methods, BCT achieves finer compression of the entire transformer by operating blockwise. This method mitigates data distribution deviation caused by quantization, eliminating the requirement for retraining. BCT effectively compresses all components of the model, including but not limited to the embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU, Softmax, layer normalization, and intermediate results. In a case study, an efficient model is compressed by BCT achieving up to 7.988x compression. Subsequently, we also evaluate it on several General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) datasets.

  Chao, Yue Zhang",Is ChatGPT a Highly Fluent Grammatical Error Correction System? A Comprehensive Evaluation,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  ChatGPT, a large-scale language model based on the advanced GPT-3.5 architecture, has shown remarkable potential in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five official test sets in three different languages, along with three document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent, possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and low-resource settings highlights its potential in multilingual GEC tasks. However, further analysis of various types of errors at the document-level has shown that ChatGPT cannot effectively correct agreement, coreference, tense errors across sentences, and cross-sentence boundary errors.

Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines, and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

  Kwon, Chris Bryan","PromptAid: Prompt Exploration, Perturbation, Testing and Iteration using Visual Analytics for Large Language Models",,,,,cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to perform ad-hoc Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with a simple natural language prompt. Part of the appeal for LLMs is their approachability to the general public, including individuals with no prior technical experience in NLP techniques. However, natural language prompts can vary significantly in terms of their linguistic structure, context, and other semantics. Modifying one or more of these aspects can result in significant differences in task performance. Non-expert users may find it challenging to identify the changes needed to improve a prompt, especially when they lack domain-specific knowledge and lack appropriate feedback. To address this challenge, we present PromptAid, a visual analytics system designed to interactively create, refine, and test prompts through exploration, perturbation, testing, and iteration. PromptAid uses multiple, coordinated visualizations which allow users to improve prompts by using the three strategies: keyword perturbations, paraphrasing perturbations, and obtaining the best set of in-context few-shot examples. PromptAid was designed through an iterative prototyping process involving NLP experts and was evaluated through quantitative and qualitative assessments for LLMs. Our findings indicate that PromptAid helps users to iterate over prompt template alterations with less cognitive overhead, generate diverse prompts with help of recommendations, and analyze the performance of the generated prompts while surpassing existing state-of-the-art prompting interfaces in performance.

However, one critical issue with existing techniques is that, while developers want rationales for the provided automatic debugging results, existing techniques are ill-suited to provide them, as their deduction process differs significantly from that of human developers. Inspired by the way developers interact with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging (AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts large language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to actively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions prior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging more closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible explanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the explanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our empirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD performs competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can indicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human study with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate the utility of explanations from AutoSD. Participants with access to explanations could judge patch correctness in roughly the same time as those without, but their accuracy improved for five out of six real-world bugs studied: 70% of participants answered that they wanted explanations when using repair tools, while 55% answered that they were satisfied with the Scientific Debugging presentation.

However, these models are only accessible through restricted APIs, which creates barriers to new research and advancements in the field. Therefore, we propose the $\mathbf{ParroT}$ framework to enhance and regulate the translation abilities during chat based on open-sourced LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-7b, BLOOMZ-7b-mt) and human written translation and evaluation data. Specifically, ParroT reformulates translation data into the instruction-following style, and introduces a ""$\mathbf{Hint}$"" field for incorporating extra requirements to regulate the translation process. Accordingly, we propose three instruction types for finetuning ParroT models, including translation instruction, contrastive instruction, and error-guided instruction. We can finetune either the full models or partial parameters via low rank adaptation (LoRA). Experiments on Flores subsets and WMT22 test sets suggest that translation instruction improves the translation performance of vanilla LLMs significantly while error-guided instruction can lead to a further improvement, which demonstrates the importance of learning from low-quality translations annotated by human. Meanwhile, the ParroT models can also preserve the ability on general tasks with the Alpaca multi-task dataset involved in finetuning.

However, accurately annotating cell types from single cell data has been a challenging task, as it requires extensive knowledge of cell biology and gene function. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and New Bing in 2023 has revolutionized this process by integrating the scientific literature and providing accurate annotations of cell types. This breakthrough enables researchers to conduct literature reviews more efficiently and accurately, and can potentially uncover new insights into cell type annotation. By using ChatGPT to annotate single cell data, we can relate rare cell type to their function and reveal specific differentiation trajectories of cell subtypes that were previously overlooked. This can have important applications in understanding cancer progression, mammalian development, and stem cell differentiation, and can potentially lead to the discovery of key cells that interrupt the differentiation pathway and solve key problems in the life sciences. Overall, the future of cell type annotation in single cell data looks promising and the Large Language model will be an important milestone in the history of single cell analysis.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR, ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide range of applications. We evaluate TagGPT on publicly available datasets, i.e., Kuaishou and Food.com, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TagGPT compared to existing hashtags and off-the-shelf taggers.

This report analyses multiple logical reasoning datasets, with popular benchmarks like LogiQA and ReClor, and newly-released datasets like AR-LSAT. We test the multi-choice reading comprehension and natural language inference tasks with benchmarks requiring logical reasoning. We further construct a logical reasoning out-of-distribution dataset to investigate the robustness of ChatGPT and GPT-4. We also make a performance comparison between ChatGPT and GPT-4. Experiment results show that ChatGPT performs significantly better than the RoBERTa fine-tuning method on most logical reasoning benchmarks. With early access to the GPT-4 API we are able to conduct intense experiments on the GPT-4 model. The results show GPT-4 yields even higher performance on most logical reasoning datasets. Among benchmarks, ChatGPT and GPT-4 do relatively well on well-known datasets like LogiQA and ReClor. However, the performance drops significantly when handling newly released and out-of-distribution datasets. Logical reasoning remains challenging for ChatGPT and GPT-4, especially on out-of-distribution and natural language inference datasets.

In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.

However, such a retrieval-based recommender paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users usually adjust the recommendations via passive and inefficient feedback such as clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success across various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations: 1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific information needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates users to express information needs more precisely via natural language instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user instructions to guide content generation.   To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and leverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs. Specifically, we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback (e.g., clicks) via an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to repurpose existing items and create new items, respectively. Eventually, GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to meet users' information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated items, we emphasize various fidelity checks such as authenticity and legality checks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing the AI editor and AI creator on micro-video generation, showing promising results.

Most existing ESE methods are retrieval-based frameworks that need to extract the contextual features of entities and calculate the similarity between seed entities and candidate entities. To achieve the two purposes, they should iteratively traverse the corpus and the entity vocabulary provided in the datasets, resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. The experimental results indicate that the time consumed by the retrieval-based ESE methods increases linearly with entity vocabulary and corpus size. In this paper, we firstly propose a generative ESE framework, Generative Entity Set Expansion (GenExpan), which utilizes a generative pre-trained language model to accomplish ESE task. Specifically, a prefix tree is employed to guarantee the validity of entity generation, and automatically generated class names are adopted to guide the model to generate target entities. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Calibration and Generative Ranking to further bridge the gap between generic knowledge of the language model and the goal of ESE task. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that GenExpan is efficient and effective. For efficiency, expansion time consumed by GenExpan is independent of entity vocabulary and corpus size, and GenExpan achieves an average 600% speedup compared to strong baselines. For expansion performance, our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art ESE methods.

We present an interpretable, unified, language checking (UniLC) method for both human and machine-generated language that aims to check if language input is factual and fair. While fairness and fact-checking tasks have been handled separately with dedicated models, we find that LLMs can achieve high performance on a combination of fact-checking, stereotype detection, and hate speech detection tasks with a simple, few-shot, unified set of prompts. With the ``1/2-shot'' multi-task language checking method proposed in this work, the GPT3.5-turbo model outperforms fully supervised baselines on several language tasks.

  date: May 2023",10.1145/3588964,,cs.DC cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  With the increasing data volume, there is a trend of using large-scale pre-trained models to store the knowledge into an enormous number of model parameters. The training of these models is composed of lots of dense algebras, requiring a huge amount of hardware resources. Recently, sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) are becoming more popular and have demonstrated impressive pretraining scalability in various downstream tasks. However, such a sparse conditional computation may not be effective as expected in practical systems due to the routing imbalance and fluctuation problems. Generally, MoEs are becoming a new data analytics paradigm in the data life cycle and suffering from unique challenges at scales, complexities, and granularities never before possible.   In this paper, we propose a novel DNN training framework, FlexMoE, which systematically and transparently address the inefficiency caused by dynamic dataflow. We first present an empirical analysis on the problems and opportunities of training MoE models, which motivates us to overcome the routing imbalance and fluctuation problems by a dynamic expert management and device placement mechanism. Then we introduce a novel scheduling module over the existing DNN runtime to monitor the data flow, make the scheduling plans, and dynamically adjust the model-to-hardware mapping guided by the real-time data traffic. A simple but efficient heuristic algorithm is exploited to dynamically optimize the device placement during training. We have conducted experiments on both NLP models (e.g., BERT and GPT) and vision models (e.g., Swin). And results show FlexMoE can achieve superior performance compared with existing systems on real-world workloads -- FlexMoE outperforms DeepSpeed by 1.70x on average and up to 2.10x, and outperforms FasterMoE by 1.30x on average and up to 1.45x.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the advantages and challenges of LLMs for MMT by answering two questions: 1) How well do LLMs perform in translating a massive number of languages? 2) Which factors affect LLMs' performance in translation? We evaluate popular LLMs, including XGLM, OPT, BLOOMZ, and ChatGPT, on 102 languages. Our empirical results show that even the best model ChatGPT still lags behind the supervised baseline NLLB in 83.33% of translation directions. Through further analysis, we discover that LLMs exhibit new working patterns when used for MMT. First, prompt semantics can surprisingly be ignored when given in-context exemplars, where LLMs still show strong performance even with unreasonable prompts. Second, cross-lingual exemplars can provide better task instruction for low-resource translation than exemplars in the same language pairs. Third, we observe the overestimated performance of BLOOMZ on dataset Flores-101, indicating the potential risk when using public datasets for evaluation.

Though model developers and researchers work hard on dialog safety to avoid generating harmful content from LLMs, it is still challenging to steer AI-generated content (AIGC) for the human good. As powerful LLMs are devouring existing text data from various domains (e.g., GPT-3 is trained on 45TB texts), it is natural to doubt whether the private information is included in the training data and what privacy threats can these LLMs and their downstream applications bring. In this paper, we study the privacy threats from OpenAI's ChatGPT and the New Bing enhanced by ChatGPT and show that application-integrated LLMs may cause new privacy threats.

InstructGPT implements RLHF through several stages, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), reward model training, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). PPO, however, is sensitive to hyperparameters and requires a minimum of four models in its standard implementation, which makes it hard to train. In contrast, we propose a novel learning paradigm called RRHF, which scores responses generated by different sampling policies and learns to align them with human preferences through ranking loss. RRHF can efficiently align language model output probabilities with human preferences as robust as fine-tuning and it only needs 1 to 2 models during tuning. In addition, RRHF can be considered an extension of SFT and reward models while being simpler than PPO in terms of coding, model counts, and hyperparameters. The entire alignment process can be accomplished within a single RRHF training session. We evaluate RRHF using LLaMA and Alpaca on Helpful and Harmless data, demonstrating performance comparable to PPO.

Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is a ""Wall Street Neophyte"" with limited success in predicting stock movements, as it underperforms not only state-of-the-art methods but also traditional methods like linear regression using price features. Despite the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting strategies and the inclusion of tweets, ChatGPT's performance remains subpar. Furthermore, we observe limitations in its explainability and stability, suggesting the need for more specialized training or fine-tuning.

Although several methods have been proposed to enhance cross-model transferability, little attention has been paid to the transferability of adversarial examples across different tasks. This issue has become increasingly relevant with the emergence of foundational multi-task AI systems such as Visual ChatGPT, rendering the utility of adversarial samples generated by a single task relatively limited. Furthermore, these systems often entail inferential functions beyond mere recognition-like tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel Visual Relation-based cross-task Adversarial Patch generation method called VRAP, which aims to evaluate the robustness of various visual tasks, especially those involving visual reasoning, such as Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning. VRAP employs scene graphs to combine object recognition-based deception with predicate-based relations elimination, thereby disrupting the visual reasoning information shared among inferential tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VRAP significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of black-box transferability across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Such biases can produce suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially serious consequences. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to address this problem, where generative models are fine-tuned with RL algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment, necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently enhancing the model by fine-tuning on these filtered samples. Our studies show that RAFT can effectively improve the model performance in both reward learning and other automated metrics in both large language models and diffusion models.

Given a natural language description of a desired task, DroidBot-GPT can automatically generate and execute actions that navigate the app to complete the task. It works by translating the app GUI state information and the available actions on the smartphone screen to natural language prompts and asking the LLM to make a choice of actions. Since the LLM is typically trained on a large amount of data including the how-to manuals of diverse software applications, it has the ability to make reasonable choices of actions based on the provided information. We evaluate DroidBot-GPT with a self-created dataset that contains 33 tasks collected from 17 Android applications spanning 10 categories. It can successfully complete 39.39% of the tasks, and the average partial completion progress is about 66.76%. Given the fact that our method is fully unsupervised (no modification required from both the app and the LLM), we believe there is great potential to enhance automation performance with better app development paradigms and/or custom model training.

LLMs' size grows by $240\times$ every two years, which outpaces the hardware progress and makes model inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is a promising approach to mitigate the widening gap between LLM size and hardware capacity. However, the existence of outliers, values with significant magnitudes, in LLMs makes existing quantization methods less effective. Prior outlier-aware quantization schemes adopt sparsity encoding techniques to separate outliers from normal values where the process requires global coordination (e.g., a global sparsity coordination list). This incurs complex encoding/decoding hardware logics and an extra orchestration controller for the computation between outlier and normal values. As such, it is not hardware-efficient and hence only achieves sub-optimal quantization benefits.   We propose OliVe, an algorithm/architecture co-designed solution that adopts an outlier-victim pair (OVP) quantization and handles outlier values locally with low hardware overheads and high performance gains. The key insight of OliVe is that outliers are important while the normal values next to them are not. Thus those normal values (called victims) can be sacrificed to accommodate outliers. This enables a memory-aligned OVP encoding scheme, which can be efficiently integrated to the existing hardware accelerators like systolic array and tensor core. As a result, OliVe-based accelerator surpasses the existing outlier-aware accelerator, GOBO, by 4.5$\times$ speedup and 4.0$\times$ energy reduction, respectively, with a superior model accuracy.

Instructors need to be able to detect such text generated by large language models, either with the naked eye or with the help of some tools. There is also growing need to understand the lexical, syntactic and stylistic features of AIGC. To address these challenges in English language teaching, we first present ArguGPT, a balanced corpus of 4,038 argumentative essays generated by 7 GPT models in response to essay prompts from three sources: (1) in-class or homework exercises, (2) TOEFL and (3) GRE writing tasks. Machine-generated texts are paired with roughly equal number of human-written essays with three score levels matched in essay prompts. We then hire English instructors to distinguish machine essays from human ones. Results show that when first exposed to machine-generated essays, the instructors only have an accuracy of 61% in detecting them. But the number rises to 67% after one round of minimal self-training. Next, we perform linguistic analyses of these essays, which show that machines produce sentences with more complex syntactic structures while human essays tend to be lexically more complex. Finally, we test existing AIGC detectors and build our own detectors using SVMs and RoBERTa. Results suggest that a RoBERTa fine-tuned with the training set of ArguGPT achieves above 90% accuracy in both essay- and sentence-level classification.

However, most recent studies only use a single prompt for tuning, neglecting the inherent step-to-step cognitive reasoning process that humans conduct in complex task settings, for example, when processing images from unfamiliar domains. Chain of Thought is a simple and effective approximation to human reasoning process and has been proven useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Based on this cognitive intuition, we believe that conducting effective reasoning is also an important problem in visual tasks, and a chain of thought could be a solution to this problem. In this work, we propose a novel chain of thought prompt tuning for vision-language modeling. Extensive experiments show that our method not only generalizes better in image classification tasks, has greater transferability beyond a single dataset, and has stronger domain generalization performance, but also performs much better in imagetext retrieval and visual question answering, which require more reasoning capabilities.

In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective method for enhancing instruction tuning by employing symbolic tasks. Compared to crowdsourced human tasks or model-generated tasks, symbolic tasks present a unique advantage as they can be easily generated in vast quantities, theoretically providing an infinite supply of high-quality training instances. To explore the potential of symbolic tasks, we carry out an extensive case study on the representative symbolic task of SQL execution. Empirical results on various benchmarks validate that the integration of SQL execution leads to significant improvements in zero-shot scenarios, particularly in table reasoning. Notably, our 3B model surpasses both the 175B GPT-3 and ChatGPT in zero-shot table reasoning across four benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental results on BBH (27 tasks) and MMLU (57 tasks) reveal that language models can be enhanced through symbolic tasks without compromising their generality. We hope that our paper serves as a catalyst, inspiring increased efforts to incorporate symbolic tasks in instruction tuning.

However, recent studies have shown that existing large models still have difficulty with information extraction tasks. For example, gpt-3.5-turbo achieved an F1 score of 18.22 on the Ontonotes dataset, which is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose InstructUIE, a unified information extraction framework based on instruction tuning, which can uniformly model various information extraction tasks and capture the inter-task dependency. To validate the proposed method, we introduce IE INSTRUCTIONS, a benchmark of 32 diverse information extraction datasets in a unified text-to-text format with expert-written instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to Bert in supervised settings and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and gpt3.5 in zero-shot settings.

This paper introduces a novel human-LLM interaction framework, Low-code LLM. It incorporates six types of simple low-code visual programming interactions, all supported by clicking, dragging, or text editing, to achieve more controllable and stable responses. Through visual interaction with a graphical user interface, users can incorporate their ideas into the workflow without writing trivial prompts. The proposed Low-code LLM framework consists of a Planning LLM that designs a structured planning workflow for complex tasks, which can be correspondingly edited and confirmed by users through low-code visual programming operations, and an Executing LLM that generates responses following the user-confirmed workflow. We highlight three advantages of the low-code LLM: controllable generation results, user-friendly human-LLM interaction, and broadly applicable scenarios. We demonstrate its benefits using four typical applications. By introducing this approach, we aim to bridge the gap between humans and LLMs, enabling more effective and efficient utilization of LLMs for complex tasks.

In this study, we undertook experimental comparisons between full-parameter fine-tuning and LoRA-based tuning methods, utilizing LLaMA as the base model. The experimental results show that the selection of the foundational model, training dataset scale, learnable parameter quantity, and model training cost are all important factors.

ChatGPT has shown great potential in software engineering to boost various traditional tasks such as program repair, code understanding, and code generation. However, whether automatic program repair (APR) applies to deep learning (DL) programs is still unknown. DL programs, whose decision logic is not explicitly encoded in the source code, have posed unique challenges to APR. While to repair DL programs, an APR approach needs to not only parse the source code syntactically but also needs to understand the code intention. With the best prior work, the performance of fault localization is still far less than satisfactory (only about 30\%). Therefore, in this paper, we explore ChatGPT's capability for DL program repair by asking three research questions. (1) Can ChatGPT debug DL programs effectively? (2) How can ChatGPT's repair performance be improved by prompting? (3) In which way can dialogue help facilitate the repair? On top of that, we categorize the common aspects useful for prompt design for DL program repair. Also, we propose various prompt templates to facilitate the performance and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT's abilities such as detecting bad code smell, code refactoring, and detecting API misuse/deprecation.

However, writing numerous impressions can be laborious and error-prone for radiologists. Although recent studies have achieved promising results in automatic impression generation using large-scale medical text data for pre-training and fine-tuning pre-trained language models, such models often require substantial amounts of medical text data and have poor generalization performance. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown strong generalization capabilities and performance, their performance in specific domains, such as radiology, remains under-investigated and potentially limited. To address this limitation, we propose ImpressionGPT, which leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs by constructing dynamic contexts using domain-specific, individualized data. This dynamic prompt approach enables the model to learn contextual knowledge from semantically similar examples from existing data. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm that performs automatic evaluation on the generated impression results and composes the corresponding instruction prompts to further optimize the model. The proposed ImpressionGPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MIMIC-CXR and OpenI datasets without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning the LLMs. This work presents a paradigm for localizing LLMs that can be applied in a wide range of similar application scenarios, bridging the gap between general-purpose LLMs and the specific language processing needs of various domains.

To tackle this challenge, biomedical text summarization (BTS) has been proposed as a solution to support clinical information retrieval and management. BTS aims at generating concise summaries that distill key information from single or multiple biomedical documents. In recent years, the rapid advancement of fundamental natural language processing (NLP) techniques, from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to large language models (LLMs), has greatly facilitated the progress of BTS. This growth has led to numerous proposed summarization methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, raising the need for a comprehensive and up-to-date survey for BTS. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in BTS, leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques from PLMs to LLMs, to help understand the latest progress, challenges, and future directions. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts of BTS, PLMs and LLMs, followed by an in-depth review of available datasets, recent approaches, and evaluation metrics in BTS.

Despite demonstrating impressive capability in various open-domain tasks, their adequacy in highly specific fields like radiology remains untested. Radiology presents unique linguistic phenomena distinct from open-domain data due to its specificity and complexity. Assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in such specific domains is crucial not only for a thorough evaluation of their overall performance but also for providing valuable insights into future model design directions: whether model design should be generic or domain-specific. To this end, in this study, we evaluate the performance of ChatGPT/GPT-4 on a radiology NLI task and compare it to other models fine-tuned specifically on task-related data samples. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on ChatGPT/GPT-4's reasoning ability by introducing varying levels of inference difficulty. Our results show that 1) GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT in the radiology NLI task; 2) other specifically fine-tuned models require significant amounts of data samples to achieve comparable performance to ChatGPT/GPT-4. These findings demonstrate that constructing a generic model that is capable of solving various tasks across different domains is feasible.

We observe that these outliers are asymmetric and concentrated in specific channels. To address this issue, we propose the Outlier Suppression+ framework. First, we introduce channel-wise shifting and scaling operations to eliminate asymmetric presentation and scale down problematic channels. We demonstrate that these operations can be seamlessly migrated into subsequent modules while maintaining equivalence. Second, we quantitatively analyze the optimal values for shifting and scaling, taking into account both the asymmetric property and quantization errors of weights in the next layer. Our lightweight framework can incur minimal performance degradation under static and standard post-training quantization settings. Comprehensive results across various tasks and models reveal that our approach achieves near-floating-point performance on both small models, such as BERT, and large language models (LLMs) including OPTs, BLOOM, and BLOOMZ at 8-bit and 6-bit settings. Furthermore, we establish a new state of the art for 4-bit BERT.

Pretrained models for network traffic can utilize large-scale raw data to learn the essential characteristics of network traffic, and generate distinguishable results for input traffic without considering specific downstream tasks. Effective pretrained models can significantly optimize the training efficiency and effectiveness of downstream tasks, such as application classification, attack detection and traffic generation. Despite the great success of pretraining in natural language processing, there is no work in the network field. Considering the diverse demands and characteristics of network traffic and network tasks, it is non-trivial to build a pretrained model for network traffic and we face various challenges, especially the heterogeneous headers and payloads in the multi-pattern network traffic and the different dependencies for contexts of diverse downstream network tasks.   To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a generative pretrained model NetGPT for both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We propose the multi-pattern network traffic modeling to construct unified text inputs and support both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We further optimize the adaptation effect of the pretrained model to diversified tasks by shuffling header fields, segmenting packets in flows, and incorporating diverse task labels with prompts. With diverse traffic datasets from encrypted software, DNS, private industrial protocols and cryptocurrency mining, expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our NetGPT in a range of traffic understanding and generation tasks on traffic datasets, and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.

In addition to pre-training techniques, inspired by the latest work in the natural language fields, more recent work has shifted towards applying effective fine-tuning approaches, such as parameter-efficient tuning (delta tuning). However, given the substantial differences between GNNs and transformer-based models, applying such approaches directly to GNNs proved to be less effective. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of delta tuning techniques for GNNs and propose a novel delta tuning method specifically designed for GNNs, called AdapterGNN. AdapterGNN preserves the knowledge of the large pre-trained model and leverages highly expressive adapters for GNNs, which can adapt to downstream tasks effectively with only a few parameters, while also improving the model's generalization ability on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that AdapterGNN achieves higher evaluation performance (outperforming full fine-tuning by 1.4% and 5.5% in the chemistry and biology domains respectively, with only 5% of its parameters tuned) and lower generalization gaps compared to full fine-tuning. Moreover, we empirically show that a larger GNN model can have a worse generalization ability, which differs from the trend observed in large language models. We have also provided a theoretical justification for delta tuning can improve the generalization ability of GNNs by applying generalization bounds.

This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting (PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance.

  Jules Jules, Ivan Ssenkungu and Pontus Stenetorp",MasakhaNEWS: News Topic Classification for African languages,Accepted to IJCNLP-AACL 2023 (main conference),,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  African languages are severely under-represented in NLP research due to lack of datasets covering several NLP tasks. While there are individual language specific datasets that are being expanded to different tasks, only a handful of NLP tasks (e.g. named entity recognition and machine translation) have standardized benchmark datasets covering several geographical and typologically-diverse African languages. In this paper, we develop MasakhaNEWS -- a new benchmark dataset for news topic classification covering 16 languages widely spoken in Africa. We provide an evaluation of baseline models by training classical machine learning models and fine-tuning several language models. Furthermore, we explore several alternatives to full fine-tuning of language models that are better suited for zero-shot and few-shot learning such as cross-lingual parameter-efficient fine-tuning (like MAD-X), pattern exploiting training (PET), prompting language models (like ChatGPT), and prompt-free sentence transformer fine-tuning (SetFit and Cohere Embedding API). Our evaluation in zero-shot setting shows the potential of prompting ChatGPT for news topic classification in low-resource African languages, achieving an average performance of 70 F1 points without leveraging additional supervision like MAD-X. In few-shot setting, we show that with as little as 10 examples per label, we achieved more than 90\% (i.e. 86.0 F1 points) of the performance of full supervised training (92.6 F1 points) leveraging the PET approach.

  https://github.com/lalithjets/SurgicalGPT",,,,cs.CV cs.AI eess.IV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Advances in GPT-based large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing natural language processing, exponentially increasing its use across various domains. Incorporating uni-directional attention, these autoregressive LLMs can generate long and coherent paragraphs. However, for visual question answering (VQA) tasks that require both vision and language processing, models with bi-directional attention or models employing fusion techniques are often employed to capture the context of multiple modalities all at once. As GPT does not natively process vision tokens, to exploit the advancements in GPT models for VQA in robotic surgery, we design an end-to-end trainable Language-Vision GPT (LV-GPT) model that expands the GPT2 model to include vision input (image). The proposed LV-GPT incorporates a feature extractor (vision tokenizer) and vision token embedding (token type and pose). Given the limitations of unidirectional attention in GPT models and their ability to generate coherent long paragraphs, we carefully sequence the word tokens before vision tokens, mimicking the human thought process of understanding the question to infer an answer from an image. Quantitatively, we prove that the LV-GPT model outperforms other state-of-the-art VQA models on two publically available surgical-VQA datasets (based on endoscopic vision challenge robotic scene segmentation 2018 and CholecTriplet2021) and on our newly annotated dataset (based on the holistic surgical scene dataset). We further annotate all three datasets to include question-type annotations to allow sub-type analysis. Furthermore, we extensively study and present the effects of token sequencing, token type and pose embedding for vision tokens in the LV-GPT model.

In this paper, we seek to understand whether ChatGPT has the potential to reproduce human-generated label annotations in social computing tasks. Such an achievement could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of social computing research. As such, we use ChatGPT to relabel five seminal datasets covering stance detection (2x), sentiment analysis, hate speech, and bot detection. Our results highlight that ChatGPT does have the potential to handle these data annotation tasks, although a number of challenges remain. ChatGPT obtains an average accuracy 0.609. Performance is highest for the sentiment analysis dataset, with ChatGPT correctly annotating 64.9% of tweets. Yet, we show that performance varies substantially across individual labels.

A Preliminary Study,,,,,cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recommendation systems have witnessed significant advancements and have been widely used over the past decades. However, most traditional recommendation methods are task-specific and therefore lack efficient generalization ability. Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has significantly advanced NLP tasks by enhancing the capabilities of conversational models. Nonetheless, the application of ChatGPT in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we employ ChatGPT as a general-purpose recommendation model to explore its potential for transferring extensive linguistic and world knowledge acquired from large-scale corpora to recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we design a set of prompts and evaluate ChatGPT's performance on five recommendation scenarios. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, we do not fine-tune ChatGPT during the entire evaluation process, relying only on the prompts themselves to convert recommendation tasks into natural language tasks. Further, we explore the use of few-shot prompting to inject interaction information that contains user potential interest to help ChatGPT better understand user needs and interests. Comprehensive experimental results on Amazon Beauty dataset show that ChatGPT has achieved promising results in certain tasks and is capable of reaching the baseline level in others. We conduct human evaluations on two explainability-oriented tasks to more accurately evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models. And the human evaluations show ChatGPT can truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results. We hope that our study can inspire researchers to further explore the potential of language models like ChatGPT to improve recommendation performance and contribute to the advancement of the recommendation systems field.

We conduct extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods for CSKB Population on the new evaluation set for future research comparisons.

Evaluating and enhancing their safety is particularly essential for the wide application of large language models (LLMs). To further promote the safe deployment of LLMs, we develop a Chinese LLM safety assessment benchmark. Our benchmark explores the comprehensive safety performance of LLMs from two perspectives: 8 kinds of typical safety scenarios and 6 types of more challenging instruction attacks. Our benchmark is based on a straightforward process in which it provides the test prompts and evaluates the safety of the generated responses from the evaluated model. In evaluation, we utilize the LLM's strong evaluation ability and develop it as a safety evaluator by prompting. On top of this benchmark, we conduct safety assessments and analyze 15 LLMs including the OpenAI GPT series and other well-known Chinese LLMs, where we observe some interesting findings. For example, we find that instruction attacks are more likely to expose safety issues of all LLMs. Moreover, to promote the development and deployment of safe, responsible, and ethical AI, we publicly release SafetyPrompts including 100k augmented prompts and responses by LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 20 Apr 2023 16:27:35 GMT'}]",2023-04-21,"[['Sun', 'Hao', ''], ['Zhang', 'Zhexin', ''], ['Deng', 'Jiawen', ''], ['Cheng', 'Jiale', ''], ['Huang', 'Minlie', '']]",1,1,2023-04-20,1,5,1,2,0,2,59fc49dfd81b92661437eaf7e339c0792ccd8755,258236069.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59fc49dfd81b92661437eaf7e339c0792ccd8755,arXiv.org,2023.0,25.0,23.0,5.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '144990601', 'name': 'Hao Sun'}, {'authorId': '101371510', 'name': 'Zhexin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2090444914', 'name': 'Jiawen Deng'}, {'authorId': '2109077637', 'name': 'Jiale Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2196817617', 'name': 'Minlie Huang'}]","['The CoAI group, DCST; Institute for Artificial Intelligence; State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems;', 'Tsinghua University']",['China'],2023-04

However, LLMs currently have difficulty in bridging perception, language understanding and reasoning capabilities due to incompatibility of the underlying information flow among them, making it challenging to accomplish tasks autonomously. On the other hand, abductive learning (ABL) frameworks for integrating the two abilities of perception and reasoning has seen significant success in inverse decipherment of incomplete facts, but it is limited by the lack of semantic understanding of logical reasoning rules and the dependence on complicated domain knowledge representation. This paper presents a novel method (ChatABL) for integrating LLMs into the ABL framework, aiming at unifying the three abilities in a more user-friendly and understandable manner. The proposed method uses the strengths of LLMs' understanding and logical reasoning to correct the incomplete logical facts for optimizing the performance of perceptual module, by summarizing and reorganizing reasoning rules represented in natural language format. Similarly, perceptual module provides necessary reasoning examples for LLMs in natural language format. The variable-length handwritten equation deciphering task, an abstract expression of the Mayan calendar decoding, is used as a testbed to demonstrate that ChatABL has reasoning ability beyond most existing state-of-the-art methods, which has been well supported by comparative studies. To our best knowledge, the proposed ChatABL is the first attempt to explore a new pattern for further approaching human-level cognitive ability via natural language interaction with ChatGPT.

  (ICSE 2024)",,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions for a code snippet to facilitate developers' program comprehension activities. Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this limitation, this study empirically investigates the feasibility of utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate comments that can fulfill developers' diverse intents. Our intuition is based on the facts that (1) the code and its pairwise comment are used during the pre-training process of LLMs to build the semantic connection between the natural language and programming language, and (2) comments in the real-world projects, which are collected for the pre-training, usually contain different developers' intents. We thus postulate that the LLMs can already understand the code from different perspectives after the pre-training. Indeed, experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the rationale of our insights: by adopting the in-context learning paradigm and giving adequate prompts to the LLM (e.g., providing it with ten or more examples), the LLM can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art supervised learning approach on generating comments with multiple intents. Results also show that customized strategies for constructing the prompts and post-processing strategies for reranking the results can both boost the LLM's performances, which shed light on future research directions for using LLMs to achieve comment generation.

However, the reasoning chains of demonstrations generated by LLMs are prone to errors, which can subsequently lead to incorrect reasoning during inference. Furthermore, inappropriate exemplars (overly simplistic or complex), can affect overall performance among varying levels of difficulty. We introduce Iter-CoT (Iterative bootstrapping in Chain-of-Thoughts Prompting), an iterative bootstrapping approach for selecting exemplars and generating reasoning chains. By utilizing iterative bootstrapping, our approach enables LLMs to autonomously rectify errors, resulting in more precise and comprehensive reasoning chains.

  Cheung, Jeff Kramer",Nuances are the Key: Unlocking ChatGPT to Find Failure-Inducing Tests with Differential Prompting,"Accepted to the 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated
  Software Engineering (ASE 2023)",,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Automatically detecting software failures is an important task and a longstanding challenge. It requires finding failure-inducing test cases whose test input can trigger the software's fault, and constructing an automated oracle to detect the software's incorrect behaviors. Recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates us to study how far this challenge can be addressed by ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM. Unfortunately, our study shows that ChatGPT has a low probability (28.8%) of finding correct failure-inducing test cases for buggy programs. A possible reason is that finding failure-inducing test cases requires analyzing the subtle code differences between a buggy program and its correct version. When these two versions have similar syntax, ChatGPT is weak at recognizing subtle code differences. Our insight is that ChatGPT's performance can be substantially enhanced when ChatGPT is guided to focus on the subtle code difference. We have an interesting observation that ChatGPT is effective in inferring the intended behaviors of a buggy program. The intended behavior can be leveraged to synthesize programs, in order to make the subtle code difference between a buggy program and its correct version (i.e., the synthesized program) explicit. Driven by this observation, we propose a novel approach that synergistically combines ChatGPT and differential testing to find failure-inducing test cases. We evaluate our approach on Quixbugs (a benchmark of buggy programs), and compare it with state-of-the-art baselines, including direct use of ChatGPT and Pynguin. The experimental result shows that our approach has a much higher probability (77.8%) of finding correct failure-inducing test cases, 2.7X as the best baseline.

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills.

The attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture is a critical component of LLMs, as it allows the model to selectively focus on specific input parts. The softmax unit, which is a key part of the attention mechanism, normalizes the attention scores. Hence, the performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks depends significantly on the crucial role played by the attention mechanism with the softmax unit.   In-context learning, as one of the celebrated abilities of recent LLMs, is an important concept in querying LLMs such as ChatGPT. Without further parameter updates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples. However, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well understood. Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the in-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear regression formulation $\min_x\| Ax - b \|_2$, which show Transformers' capability of learning linear functions in context.   In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression formulation $\min_{x} \| \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b \|_2$ of Transformer's attention mechanism. We show the upper bounds of the data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and by gradient-descent on a $\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function, which imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental regression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show great similarity.

Large language models (LLMs) work well in natural language generation tasks, but they are not specifically pre-trained to understand the syntax and semantics of SQL commands. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based framework for Text-to-SQL which retrieves helpful demonstration examples to prompt LLMs. However, questions with different database schemes can vary widely, even if the intentions behind them are similar and the corresponding SQL queries exhibit similarities. Consequently, it becomes crucial to identify the appropriate SQL demonstrations that align with our requirements. We design a de-semanticization mechanism that extracts question skeletons, allowing us to retrieve similar examples based on their structural similarity. We also model the relationships between question tokens and database schema items (i.e., tables and columns) to filter out scheme-related information. Our framework adapts the range of the database schema in prompts to balance length and valuable information.

To address this limitation, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory (SCM) system to unleash infinite-length input capacity for large-scale language models. Our SCM system is composed of three key modules: the language model agent, the memory stream, and the memory controller. The language model agent iteratively processes ultra-long inputs and stores all historical information in the memory stream. The memory controller provides the agent with both long-term memory (archived memory) and short-term memory (flash memory) to generate precise and coherent responses. The controller determines which memories from archived memory should be activated and how to incorporate them into the model input. Our SCM system can be integrated with any LLMs to enable them to process ultra-long texts without any modification or fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our SCM system enables LLMs, which are not optimized for multi-turn dialogue, to achieve multi-turn dialogue capabilities that are comparable to ChatGPT, and to outperform ChatGPT in scenarios involving ultra-long document summarization or long-term conversations. Additionally, we will supply a test set, which covers common long-text input scenarios, for evaluating the abilities of LLMs in processing long documents.~\footnote{Working in progress.}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/wbbeyourself/SCM4LLMs}} ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:25:31 GMT'}]",2023-04-27,"[['Liang', 'Xinnian', ''], ['Wang', 'Bing', ''], ['Huang', 'Hui', ''], ['Wu', 'Shuangzhi', ''], ['Wu', 'Peihao', ''], ['Lu', 'Lu', ''], ['Ma', 'Zejun', ''], ['Li', 'Zhoujun', '']]",1,1,2023-04-26,1,8,1,1,0,1,7806aed0e00bcc8d3d84b15f5dab318b5400b7f0,258331553.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7806aed0e00bcc8d3d84b15f5dab318b5400b7f0,arXiv.org,2023.0,28.0,9.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '120436437', 'name': 'Xinnian Liang'}, {'authorId': '38697342', 'name': 'Bin Wang'}, {'authorId': '2146086470', 'name': 'Huijia Huang'}, {'authorId': '2362902', 'name': 'Shuangzhi Wu'}, {'authorId': '3360572', 'name': 'Peihao Wu'}, {'authorId': '2215402606', 'name': 'Lu Lu'}, {'authorId': '2919563', 'name': 'Zejun Ma'}, {'authorId': '2144279674', 'name': 'Zhoujun Li'}]","['Harbin Institute of Technology', 'Beihang University', 'ByteDance']",['China'],2023-04

More importantly, while more and more companies and institutions release their LLMs, the origin can be hard to trace. Since LLMs are heading towards the time of AGI, similar to the origin tracing in anthropology, it is of great importance to trace the origin of LLMs. In this paper, we first raise the concern of the origin tracing of LLMs and propose an effective method to trace and detect AI-generated contexts. We introduce a novel algorithm that leverages the contrastive features between LLMs and extracts model-wise features to trace the text origins. Our proposed method works under both white-box and black-box settings therefore can be widely generalized to detect various LLMs.(e.g. can be generalized to detect GPT-3 models without the GPT-3 models). Also, our proposed method requires only limited data compared with the supervised learning methods and can be extended to trace new-coming model origins. We construct extensive experiments to examine whether we can trace the origins of given texts. We provide valuable observations based on the experimental results, such as the difficulty level of AI origin tracing, and the AI origin similarities, and call for ethical concerns of LLM providers. We are releasing all codes and data as a toolkit and benchmark for future AI origin tracing and detecting studies. \footnote{We are releasing all available resource at \url{https://github.com/OpenLMLab/}.} ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 27 Apr 2023 10:05:57 GMT'}]",2023-04-28,"[['Li', 'Linyang', ''], ['Wang', 'Pengyu', ''], ['Ren', 'Ke', ''], ['Sun', 'Tianxiang', ''], ['Qiu', 'Xipeng', '']]",0,1,2023-04-27,1,5,1,1,0,1,7a30650265477ebe0dc6fc6ce0b54be8644c5226,258352714.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a30650265477ebe0dc6fc6ce0b54be8644c5226,arXiv.org,2023.0,38.0,6.0,1.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2107897400', 'name': 'Linyang Li'}, {'authorId': '2199600227', 'name': 'Pengyu Wang'}, {'authorId': '2072596885', 'name': 'Kerong Ren'}, {'authorId': '153345698', 'name': 'Tianxiang Sun'}, {'authorId': '2188058565', 'name': 'Xipeng Qiu'}]",['Fudan University'],['China'],2023-04

In this study, we introduce mPLUG-Owl, a novel training paradigm that equips LLMs with multi-modal abilities through modularized learning of foundation LLM, a visual knowledge module, and a visual abstractor module. This approach can support multiple modalities and facilitate diverse unimodal and multimodal abilities through modality collaboration. The training paradigm of mPLUG-Owl involves a two-stage method for aligning image and text, which learns visual knowledge with the assistance of LLM while maintaining and even improving the generation abilities of LLM. In the first stage, the visual knowledge module and abstractor module are trained with a frozen LLM module to align the image and text. In the second stage, language-only and multi-modal supervised datasets are used to jointly fine-tune a low-rank adaption (LoRA) module on LLM and the abstractor module by freezing the visual knowledge module. We carefully build a visually-related instruction evaluation set OwlEval. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-modal models, demonstrating mPLUG-Owl's impressive instruction and visual understanding ability, multi-turn conversation ability, and knowledge reasoning ability. Besides, we observe some unexpected and exciting abilities such as multi-image correlation and scene text understanding, which makes it possible to leverage it for harder real scenarios, such as vision-only document comprehension.

However, the optimal way to implement residual connections in Transformer, which are essential for effective training, is still debated. Two widely used variants are the Post-Layer-Normalization (Post-LN) and Pre-Layer-Normalization (Pre-LN) Transformers, which apply layer normalization after each residual block's output or before each residual block's input, respectively. While both variants enjoy their advantages, they also suffer from severe limitations: Post-LN causes gradient vanishing issue that hinders training deep Transformers, and Pre-LN causes representation collapse issue that limits model capacity. In this paper, we propose ResiDual, a novel Transformer architecture with Pre-Post-LN (PPLN), which fuses the connections in Post-LN and Pre-LN together and inherits their advantages while avoids their limitations. We conduct both theoretical analyses and empirical experiments to verify the effectiveness of ResiDual. Theoretically, we prove that ResiDual has a lower bound on the gradient to avoid the vanishing issue due to the residual connection from Pre-LN. Moreover, ResiDual also has diverse model representations to avoid the collapse issue due to the residual connection from Post-LN. Empirically, ResiDual outperforms both Post-LN and Pre-LN on several machine translation benchmarks across different network depths and data sizes. Thanks to the good theoretical and empirical performance, ResiDual Transformer can serve as a foundation architecture for different AI models (e.g., large language models).

Given ChatGPT's promising performance across various tasks, we conduct extensive evaluations on the whole test sets of 13 datasets, including temporal and causal relations, PDTB2.0-based and dialogue-based discourse relations, and downstream applications on discourse understanding. To achieve reliable results, we adopt three tailored prompt templates for each task, including the zero-shot prompt template, zero-shot prompt engineering (PE) template, and in-context learning (ICL) prompt template, to establish the initial baseline scores for all popular sentence-pair relation classification tasks for the first time. We find that ChatGPT exhibits strong performance in detecting and reasoning about causal relations, while it may not be proficient in identifying the temporal order between two events. It can recognize most discourse relations with existing explicit discourse connectives, but the implicit discourse relation still remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, ChatGPT performs poorly in the dialogue discourse parsing task that requires structural understanding in a dialogue before being aware of the discourse relation.

The predominant approaches towards the automation of solving ML tasks (e.g., AutoML) are often time consuming and hard to understand for human developers. In contrast, though human engineers have the incredible ability to understand tasks and reason about solutions, their experience and knowledge are often sparse and difficult to utilize by quantitative approaches. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between machine intelligence and human knowledge by introducing a novel framework MLCopilot, which leverages the state-of-the-art LLMs to develop ML solutions for novel tasks. We showcase the possibility of extending the capability of LLMs to comprehend structured inputs and perform thorough reasoning for solving novel ML tasks. And we find that, after some dedicated design, the LLM can (i) observe from the existing experiences of ML tasks and (ii) reason effectively to deliver promising results for new tasks.

However, most existing models struggle to extract separable feature representations when performing feature embedding and struggle to build compact descriptions of normal features when performing one-class classification. One direct consequence of this is that most models perform poorly in detecting logical anomalies which violate contextual relationships. Focusing on more effective and comprehensive anomaly detection, we propose a network based on self-supervised learning and self-attentive graph convolution (SLSG) for anomaly detection. SLSG uses a generative pre-training network to assist the encoder in learning the embedding of normal patterns and the reasoning of position relationships. Subsequently, SLSG introduces the pseudo-prior knowledge of anomaly through simulated abnormal samples. By comparing the simulated anomalies, SLSG can better summarize the normal features and narrow down the hypersphere used for one-class classification. In addition, with the construction of a more general graph structure, SLSG comprehensively models the dense and sparse relationships among elements in the image, which further strengthens the detection of logical anomalies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SLSG achieves superior anomaly detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Initial attempts have leveraged the exceptional capabilities of LLMs, such as rich knowledge and strong generalization through In-context Learning, which involves phrasing the recommendation task as prompts. Nevertheless, the performance of LLMs in recommendation tasks remains suboptimal due to a substantial disparity between the training tasks for LLMs and recommendation tasks, as well as inadequate recommendation data during pre-training. To bridge the gap, we consider building a Large Recommendation Language Model by tunning LLMs with recommendation data. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective Tuning framework for Aligning LLMs with Recommendation, namely TALLRec. We have demonstrated that the proposed TALLRec framework can significantly enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs in the movie and book domains, even with a limited dataset of fewer than 100 samples. Additionally, the proposed framework is highly efficient and can be executed on a single RTX 3090 with LLaMA-7B. Furthermore, the fine-tuned LLM exhibits robust cross-domain generalization.

  https://github.com/VPGTrans/VPGTrans",,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  While developing a new vision-language LLM (VL-LLM) by pre-training on tremendous image-text pairs from scratch can be exceedingly resource-consuming, connecting an existing LLM with a comparatively lightweight visual prompt generator (VPG) becomes a feasible paradigm. However, further tuning the VPG part of the VL-LLM still suffers from indispensable computational costs, i.e., requiring thousands of GPU hours and millions of training data. One alternative solution is to transfer an existing VPG from any existing VL-LLMs for the target VL-LLM.   In this work, we for the first time investigate the VPG transferability across LLMs, and explore a solution to reduce the cost of VPG transfer. We first study the VPG transfer across different LLM sizes (e.g., small-to-large), and across different LLM types, through which we diagnose the key factors to maximize the transfer efficiency. Based on our observation, we design a two-stage transfer framework named VPGTrans, which is simple yet highly effective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VPGTrans helps significantly speed up the transfer learning process without compromising performance. Remarkably, it helps achieve the VPG transfer from BLIP-2 OPT$_\text{2.7B}$ to BLIP-2 OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ with over 10 times speed-up and 10.7% training data compared with connecting a VPG to OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ from scratch. Further, a series of intriguing findings and potential rationales behind them are provided and discussed. Finally, we showcase the practical value of our VPGTrans approach, by customizing two novel VL-LLMs, including VL-LLaMA and VL-Vicuna, with recently released LLaMA and Vicuna LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Tue, 2 May 2023 09:28:39 GMT'}]",2023-05-03,"[['Zhang', 'Ao', ''], ['Fei', 'Hao', ''], ['Yao', 'Yuan', ''], ['Ji', 'Wei', ''], ['Li', 'Li', ''], ['Liu', 'Zhiyuan', ''], ['Chua', 'Tat-Seng', '']]",0,0,2023-05-02,1,7,3,3,3,0,0046306876ff2d5600699327e52bc29fa5e9ec91,258436945.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0046306876ff2d5600699327e52bc29fa5e9ec91,arXiv.org,2023.0,61.0,32.0,6.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2153656874', 'name': 'Ao Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2142672912', 'name': 'Hao Fei'}, {'authorId': '1390925224', 'name': 'Yuan Yao'}, {'authorId': '2072613978', 'name': 'Wei Ji'}, {'authorId': '2156062791', 'name': 'Li Li'}, {'authorId': '1390625267', 'name': 'Zhiyuan Liu'}, {'authorId': '143779329', 'name': 'Tat-seng Chua'}]","['National University of Singapore', 'Tsinghua University', '37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).']","['China', 'Singapore']",2023-05

Despite the great success, mainstream solutions largely follow the pre-training then finetuning paradigm, which brings in both high deployment costs and low training efficiency. Nevertheless, fine-tuning on a specific task is essential because PLMs are only pre-trained with language signal from large raw data. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-free strategy for language models, to consider both language signal and teacher signal. Teacher signal is an abstraction of a battery of downstream tasks, provided in a unified proposition format.

However, the discrete nature of natural language makes it difficult to ensure the quality of positive and negative sample pairs generated through data augmentation methods. Although supervised contrastive learning can produce more accurate sample pairs with human feedback labels, it still lacks fine-grained training signals. In this paper, we propose to improve \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning of sentence embeddings from \textbf{AI} \textbf{F}eedback \textbf{(CLAIF)}. Our method utilizes AI feedback from large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to construct sample pairs with fine-grained sample similarity scores to improve contrastive learning. Besides, we combine human feedback and AI feedback to provide better supervision signals for supervised contrastive learning of sentence embeddings. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer learning tasks compared to other unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning methods.

This is due to the two major shortcomings of LLMs in RE: (1) low relevance regarding entity and relation in retrieved demonstrations for in-context learning; and (2) the strong inclination to wrongly classify NULL examples into other pre-defined labels.   In this paper, we propose GPT-RE to bridge the gap between LLMs and fully-supervised baselines. GPT-RE successfully addresses the aforementioned issues by (1) incorporating task-specific entity representations in demonstration retrieval; and (2) enriching the demonstrations with gold label-induced reasoning logic. We evaluate GPT-RE on four widely-used RE datasets, and observe that GPT-RE achieves improvements over not only existing GPT-3 baselines, but also fully-supervised baselines. Specifically, GPT-RE achieves SOTA performances on the Semeval and SciERC datasets, and competitive performances on the TACRED and ACE05 datasets.

In this paper, we propose FAME (FAithful question answering with MontE-carlo planning) to answer questions based on faithful reasoning steps. The reasoning steps are organized as a structured entailment tree, which shows how premises are used to produce intermediate conclusions that can prove the correctness of the answer. We formulate the task as a discrete decision-making problem and solve it through the interaction of a reasoning environment and a controller. The environment is modular and contains several basic task-oriented modules, while the controller proposes actions to assemble the modules. Since the search space could be large, we introduce a Monte-Carlo planning algorithm to do a look-ahead search and select actions that will eventually lead to high-quality steps. FAME achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark. It can produce valid and faithful reasoning steps compared with large language models with a much smaller model size.

Testing and Repairing Unethical Suggestions of Large Language Models with Suggest-Critique-Reflect Process",,,,,cs.SE cs.AI cs.HC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  As the popularity of large language models (LLMs) soars across various applications, ensuring their alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. In particular, given that LLMs have great potential to serve as general-purpose AI assistants in daily life, their subtly unethical suggestions become a serious and real concern. Tackling the challenge of automatically testing and repairing unethical suggestions is thus demanding.   This paper introduces the first framework for testing and repairing unethical suggestions made by LLMs. We first propose ETHICSSUITE, a test suite that presents complex, contextualized, and realistic moral scenarios to test LLMs. We then propose a novel suggest-critic-reflect (SCR) process, serving as an automated test oracle to detect unethical suggestions. We recast deciding if LLMs yield unethical suggestions (a hard problem; often requiring human expertise and costly to decide) into a PCR task that can be automatically checked for violation. Moreover, we propose a novel on-the-fly (OTF) repairing scheme that repairs unethical suggestions made by LLMs in real-time. The OTF scheme is applicable to LLMs in a black-box API setting with moderate cost. With ETHICSSUITE, our study on seven popular LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4) uncovers in total 109,824 unethical suggestions. We apply our OTF scheme on two LLMs (Llama-13B and ChatGPT), which generates valid repair to a considerable amount of unethical ones, paving the way for more ethically conscious LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 4 May 2023 08:00:32 GMT'}]",2023-05-05,"[['Ma', 'Pingchuan', ''], ['Li', 'Zongjie', ''], ['Sun', 'Ao', ''], ['Wang', 'Shuai', '']]",1,1,2023-05-04,1,4,3,3,1,2,24ef856534bbc0931c8bf5d2e754fda1bdedcde2,258480241.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24ef856534bbc0931c8bf5d2e754fda1bdedcde2,arXiv.org,2023.0,65.0,7.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '1384480816', 'name': 'Pingchuan Ma'}, {'authorId': '2118207559', 'name': 'Zongjie Li'}, {'authorId': '2179593108', 'name': 'Ao Sun'}, {'authorId': '2118511999', 'name': 'Shuai Wang'}]",['Hong Kong University of Science and Technology'],['China'],2023-05

In this paper, we focus on speeding up pre-training by progressively growing from a small Transformer structure to a large one. There are two main research problems related to progressive growth: growth schedule and growth operator. For growth schedule, existing work has explored multi-stage expansion of depth and feedforward layers. However, the impact of each dimension on the schedule's efficiency is still an open question. For growth operator, existing work relies on the initialization of new weights to inherit knowledge, and achieve only non-strict function preservation, limiting further optimization of training dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Masked Structural Growth (MSG), including growth schedules involving all possible dimensions and strictly function-preserving growth operators that is independent of the initialization of new weights. Experiments show that MSG is significantly faster than related work: we achieve a speed-up of 80% for Bert-base and 120% for Bert-large pre-training. Moreover, MSG is able to improve fine-tuning performances at the same time.

On the other hand, population-based algorithms offer a natural exploration strategy, but their heuristic black-box operators are inefficient. Recent algorithms have integrated these two methods, connecting them through a shared replay buffer. However, the effect of using diverse data from population optimization iterations on off-policy RL algorithms has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we first analyze the use of off-policy RL algorithms in combination with population-based algorithms, showing that the use of population data could introduce an overlooked error and harm performance. To test this, we propose a uniform and scalable training design and conduct experiments on our tailored framework in robot locomotion tasks from the OpenAI gym. Our results substantiate that using population data in off-policy RL can cause instability during training and even degrade performance. To remedy this issue, we further propose a double replay buffer design that provides more on-policy data and show its effectiveness through experiments. Our results offer practical insights for training these hybrid methods.

A BIg Bench for Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Text-to-SQL parsing, which aims at converting natural language instructions into executable SQLs, has gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, Codex and ChatGPT have shown impressive results in this task. However, most of the prevalent benchmarks, i.e., Spider, and WikiSQL, focus on database schema with few rows of database contents leaving the gap between academic study and real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, we present Bird, a big benchmark for large-scale database grounded in text-to-SQL tasks, containing 12,751 pairs of text-to-SQL data and 95 databases with a total size of 33.4 GB, spanning 37 professional domains. Our emphasis on database values highlights the new challenges of dirty database contents, external knowledge between NL questions and database contents, and SQL efficiency, particularly in the context of massive databases. To solve these problems, text-to-SQL models must feature database value comprehension in addition to semantic parsing. The experimental results demonstrate the significance of database values in generating accurate text-to-SQLs for big databases. Furthermore, even the most effective text-to-SQL models, i.e. ChatGPT, only achieves 40.08% in execution accuracy, which is still far from the human result of 92.96%, proving that challenges still stand. Besides, we also provide an efficiency analysis to offer insights into generating text-to-efficient-SQLs that are beneficial to industries. We believe that BIRD will contribute to advancing real-world applications of text-to-SQL research. The leaderboard and source code are available: https://bird-bench.github.io/.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \emph{T-SciQ} that aims at teaching science question answering with LLM signals. The T-SciQ approach generates high-quality CoT rationales as teaching signals and is advanced to train much smaller models to perform CoT reasoning in complex modalities. Additionally, we introduce a novel data mixing strategy to produce more effective teaching data samples by policy for simple and complex science question answer problems. Extensive experimental results show that our T-SciQ method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the ScienceQA benchmark, with an accuracy of 96.18\%. Moreover, our approach outperforms the most powerful fine-tuned baseline by 4.5\%.

However, two major limitations hinder its potential applications: (1) the inflexibility of finetuning on downstream tasks and (2) the lack of interpretability in the decision-making process. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages the power of ChatGPT for specific tasks, such as text classification, while improving its interpretability. The proposed framework conducts a knowledge graph extraction task to extract refined and structural knowledge from the raw data using ChatGPT. The rich knowledge is then converted into a graph, which is further used to train an interpretable linear classifier to make predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on four datasets. The result shows that our method can significantly improve the performance compared to directly utilizing ChatGPT for text classification tasks. And our method provides a more transparent decision-making process compared with previous text classification methods.

Based on the assumption that nearly optimal prompts for similar tasks exist in a common subspace, we propose identifying such subspaces by meta-learning on a set of similar source tasks. Therefore, for a target task that shares similarities with source tasks, we guarantee that optimizing in the subspace can find a prompt that performs well on the target task.

Regarding Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core processor for multimodal information, our paper introduces LMEye, a human-like eye with a play-and-plug interactive perception network, designed to enable dynamic interaction between LLMs and external vision information. Previous methods incorporate visual information into LLMs with a simple visual mapping network or Q-former from BLIP-2. Such networks project the image feature once yet do not consider the interaction between the image and the human input query. Hence, the obtained visual information without being connected to human intention may be inadequate for LLMs to generate intention-following responses, which we refer to as static visual information. LMEye addresses this issue by allowing the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned with various human instructions, which we term as the dynamic visual information interaction. Specifically, LMEye consists of a simple visual mapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It also contains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs, performing request-based visual information interaction, and transmitting the resulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way, LLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request to the request-based visual information interaction module, and generate the response based on the interleaved multimodal information. We evaluate LMEye through extensive experiments on some multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves the zero-shot performance on various multimodal tasks compared to previous methods, with less parameters.

To tackle multi-step reasoning tasks, few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting includes a few manually crafted step-by-step reasoning demonstrations which enable LLMs to explicitly generate reasoning steps and improve their reasoning task accuracy. To eliminate the manual effort, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with ""Let's think step by step"" as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors, missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. To address the missing-step errors, we propose Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting. It consists of two components: first, devising a plan to divide the entire task into smaller subtasks, and then carrying out the subtasks according to the plan. To address the calculation errors and improve the quality of generated reasoning steps, we extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions and derive PS+ prompting. We evaluate our proposed prompting strategy on ten datasets across three reasoning problems. The experimental results over GPT-3 show that our proposed zero-shot prompting consistently outperforms Zero-shot-CoT across all datasets by a large margin, is comparable to or exceeds Zero-shot-Program-of-Thought Prompting, and has comparable performance with 8-shot CoT prompting on the math reasoning problem.

Among their numerous skills, the translation abilities of LLMs have received considerable attention. In contrast to traditional machine translation that focuses solely on source-target mapping, LLM-based translation can potentially mimic the human translation process that takes many preparatory steps to ensure high-quality translation. This work aims to explore this possibility by proposing the MAPS framework, which stands for Multi-Aspect Prompting and Selection. Specifically, we enable LLMs to first analyze the given source text and extract three aspects of translation-related knowledge: keywords, topics and relevant demonstrations to guide the translation process. To filter out the noisy and unhelpful knowledge, we employ a selection mechanism based on quality estimation. Experiments suggest that MAPS brings significant and consistent improvements over text-davinci-003 and Alpaca on eight translation directions from the latest WMT22 test sets. Our further analysis shows that the extracted knowledge is critical in resolving up to 59% of hallucination mistakes in translation. Code is available at https://github.com/zwhe99/MAPS-mt.

Evaluating and Improving ChatGPT for Unit Test Generation,,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Unit testing is essential in detecting bugs in functionally-discrete program units. Manually writing high-quality unit tests is time-consuming and laborious. Although traditional techniques can generate tests with reasonable coverage, they exhibit low readability and cannot be directly adopted by developers. Recent work has shown the large potential of large language models (LLMs) in unit test generation, which can generate more human-like and meaningful test code. ChatGPT, the latest LLM incorporating instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, has performed well in various domains. However, It remains unclear how effective ChatGPT is in unit test generation.   In this work, we perform the first empirical study to evaluate ChatGPT's capability of unit test generation. Specifically, we conduct a quantitative analysis and a user study to systematically investigate the quality of its generated tests regarding the correctness, sufficiency, readability, and usability. The tests generated by ChatGPT still suffer from correctness issues, including diverse compilation errors and execution failures. Still, the passing tests generated by ChatGPT resemble manually-written tests by achieving comparable coverage, readability, and even sometimes developers' preference. Our findings indicate that generating unit tests with ChatGPT could be very promising if the correctness of its generated tests could be further improved.   Inspired by our findings above, we propose ChatTESTER, a novel ChatGPT-based unit test generation approach, which leverages ChatGPT itself to improve the quality of its generated tests. ChatTESTER incorporates an initial test generator and an iterative test refiner. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ChatTESTER by generating 34.3% more compilable tests and 18.7% more tests with correct assertions than the default ChatGPT.

However, their performance may be suboptimal for domain-specific tasks that require specialized knowledge due to limited exposure to the related data. Additionally, the lack of transparency of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, which can only be accessed via APIs, impedes further fine-tuning with domain custom data. Moreover, providing private data to the LLMs' owner leads to data privacy problems. To address these challenges, we propose the novel Parametric Knowledge Guiding (PKG) framework, which equips LLMs with a knowledge-guiding module to access relevant knowledge without altering the LLMs' parameters. Our PKG is based on open-source ""white-box"" language models, allowing offline memory of any knowledge that LLMs require. We demonstrate that our PKG framework can enhance the performance of ""black-box"" LLMs on a range of domain knowledge-intensive tasks that require factual (+7.9%), tabular (+11.9%), medical (+3.0%), and multimodal (+8.1%) knowledge.

To relieve developers from this burden, automated unit test generation techniques are developed. Existing automated unit test generation tools, such as program-analysis-based tools like EvoSuite and Randoop, lack program comprehension, resulting in unit tests with poor readability and limited assertions. Language-model-based tools, such as AthenaTest and A3Test, have limitations in the generation of correct unit tests. In this paper, we introduce ChatUniTest, a ChatGPT-based automated unit test generation tool developed under the Generation-Validation-Repair framework. ChatUniTest generates tests by parsing the project, extracting essential information, and creating an adaptive focal context that includes the focal method and its dependencies within the pre-defined maximum prompt token limit. The context is incorporated into a prompt and subsequently submitted to ChatGPT. Once ChatGPT's response is received, ChatUniTest proceeds to extract the raw test from the response. It then validates the test and employs rule-based repair to fix syntactic and simple compile errors, followed by ChatGPT-based repair to address challenging errors. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that ChatUniTest outperforms EvoSuite in branch and line coverage, surpasses AthenaTest and A3Test in focal method coverage, and effectively generates assertions while utilizing mock objects and reflection to achieve test objectives.

Inspired by the success of the large-scale generative pre-trained language model (GPLM) in generating high-quality textual content (e.g., summary), recent MAS methods have proposed to adapt the GPLM to this task by equipping it with the visual information, which is often obtained through a general-purpose visual feature extractor. However, the generally extracted visual features may overlook some summary-worthy visual information, which impedes model performance. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning the summary-worthy visual representation that facilitates abstractive summarization. Our method exploits the summary-worthy information from both the cross-modal transcript data and the knowledge that distills from the pseudo summary. Extensive experiments on three public multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms all competing baselines. Furthermore, with the advantages of summary-worthy visual information, our model can have a significant improvement on small datasets or even datasets with limited training data.

The AI community mainly studies this capability by fine-tuning neural networks on lots of training samples, while it is still unclear whether and how in-context learning--the prevailing few-shot paradigm based on large language models--exhibits compositional generalization. In this paper, we present CoFe, a test suite to investigate in-context compositional generalization. We find that the compositional generalization performance can be easily affected by the selection of in-context examples, thus raising the research question what the key factors are to make good in-context examples for compositional generalization. We study three potential factors: similarity, diversity and complexity. Our systematic experiments indicate that in-context examples should be structurally similar to the test case, diverse from each other, and individually simple. Furthermore, two strong limitations are observed: in-context compositional generalization on fictional words is much weaker than that on commonly used ones; it is still critical that the in-context examples should cover required linguistic structures, even though the backbone model has been pre-trained on large corpus. We hope our analysis would facilitate the understanding and utilization of in-context learning paradigm.

Standard supervised RE techniques entail training modules to tag tokens comprising entity spans and then predict the relationship between them. Recent work has instead treated the problem as a \emph{sequence-to-sequence} task, linearizing relations between entities as target strings to be generated conditioned on the input. Here we push the limits of this approach, using larger language models (GPT-3 and Flan-T5 large) than considered in prior work and evaluating their performance on standard RE tasks under varying levels of supervision. We address issues inherent to evaluating generative approaches to RE by doing human evaluations, in lieu of relying on exact matching. Under this refined evaluation, we find that: (1) Few-shot prompting with GPT-3 achieves near SOTA performance, i.e., roughly equivalent to existing fully supervised models; (2) Flan-T5 is not as capable in the few-shot setting, but supervising and fine-tuning it with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style explanations (generated via GPT-3) yields SOTA results.

However, there are limitations to semantic understanding and commonsense reasoning in existing models when the input prompts are concise narrative, resulting in low-quality image generation. To improve the capacities for narrative prompts, we propose a simple-yet-effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called the Semantic Understanding and Reasoning adapter (SUR-adapter) for pre-trained diffusion models. To reach this goal, we first collect and annotate a new dataset SURD which consists of more than 57,000 semantically corrected multi-modal samples. Each sample contains a simple narrative prompt, a complex keyword-based prompt, and a high-quality image. Then, we align the semantic representation of narrative prompts to the complex prompts and transfer knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to our SUR-adapter via knowledge distillation so that it can acquire the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities to build a high-quality textual semantic representation for text-to-image generation. We conduct experiments by integrating multiple LLMs and popular pre-trained diffusion models to show the effectiveness of our approach in enabling diffusion models to understand and reason concise natural language without image quality degradation.

Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (e.g., ""make a cake""), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (e.g., ""make a cake for diabetics""). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an overgenerate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, CoScript, which consists of 55,000 scripts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the constrained language planning ability of LLMs, especially on constraint faithfulness. Furthermore, CoScript is demonstrated to be quite effective in endowing smaller LMs with constrained language planning ability.

However, due to the lack of extensive text-to-video datasets and the necessary computational resources for training, directly applying these models for video stylization remains difficult. Also, given that the noise addition process on the input content is random and destructive, fulfilling the style transfer task's content preservation criteria is challenging. This paper proposes a zero-shot video stylization method named Style-A-Video, which utilizes a generative pre-trained transformer with an image latent diffusion model to achieve a concise text-controlled video stylization. We improve the guidance condition in the denoising process, establishing a balance between artistic expression and structure preservation. Furthermore, to decrease inter-frame flicker and avoid the formation of additional artifacts, we employ a sampling optimization and a temporal consistency module.

A common practice is to recast the task into a text-to-text format such that generative LLMs of natural language (NL-LLMs) like GPT-3 can be prompted to solve it. However, it is nontrivial to perform information extraction (IE) tasks with NL-LLMs since the output of the IE task is usually structured and therefore is hard to be converted into plain text. In this paper, we propose to recast the structured output in the form of code instead of natural language and utilize generative LLMs of code (Code-LLMs) such as Codex to perform IE tasks, in particular, named entity recognition and relation extraction. In contrast to NL-LLMs, we show that Code-LLMs can be well-aligned with these IE tasks by designing code-style prompts and formulating these IE tasks as code generation tasks. Experiment results on seven benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms fine-tuning moderate-size pre-trained models specially designed for IE tasks (e.g., UIE) and prompting NL-LLMs under few-shot settings. We further conduct a series of in-depth analyses to demonstrate the merits of leveraging Code-LLMs for IE tasks.

In this work, we address this gap by proposing ANALOGYKB, a million-scale analogy knowledge base (KB) derived from existing knowledge graphs (KGs). ANALOGYKB identifies two types of analogies from the KGs: 1) analogies of the same relations, which can be directly extracted from the KGs, and 2) analogies of analogous relations, which are identified with a selection and filtering pipeline enabled by large LMs (InstructGPT), followed by minor human efforts for data quality control. Evaluations on a series of datasets of two analogical reasoning tasks (analogy recognition and generation) demonstrate that ANALOGYKB successfully enables LMs to achieve much better results than previous state-of-the-art methods.

As prompt tuning performs poorly when directly trained on privatized data, we introduce a novel privatized token reconstruction task that is trained jointly with the downstream task, allowing LLMs to learn better task-dependent representations.

In recent years, PHM technology based on artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in the context of the industrial IoT and big data, and it is widely used in various industries, such as railway, energy, and aviation, for condition monitoring, fault prediction, and health management. The emergence of large-scale foundation models (LSF-Models) such as ChatGPT and DALLE-E marks the entry of AI into a new era of AI-2.0 from AI-1.0, where deep models have rapidly evolved from a research paradigm of single-modal, single-task, and limited-data to a multi-modal, multi-task, massive data, and super-large model paradigm. ChatGPT represents a landmark achievement in this research paradigm, offering hope for general artificial intelligence due to its highly intelligent natural language understanding ability. However, the PHM field lacks a consensus on how to respond to this significant change in the AI field, and a systematic review and roadmap is required to elucidate future development directions. To fill this gap, this paper systematically expounds on the key components and latest developments of LSF-Models.

To this end, we present a novel method, CoD, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that augmenting ChatGPT with CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x chrF++ points for MNMT (3.08 to 42.63 for English to Serbian written in Cyrillic script) on FLORES-200 full devtest set.

Our motivation is source code contains rich structural information and any code can be composed of three program structures (i.e., sequence, branch, and loop structures). Intuitively, structured intermediate reasoning steps make for structured source code. Thus, we ask LLMs to use program structures to build CoTs, obtaining SCoTs. Then, LLMs generate the final code based on SCoTs. Compared to CoT prompting, SCoT prompting explicitly constrains LLMs to think about how to solve requirements from the view of source code and further the performance of LLMs in code generation. We apply SCoT prompting to two LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT and Codex) and evaluate it on three benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, and MBCPP). (1) SCoT prompting outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline - CoT prompting by up to 13.79% in Pass@1. (2) Human evaluation shows human developers prefer programs from SCoT prompting. (3) SCoT prompting is robust to examples and achieves substantial improvements.

The de facto paradigm of LFQA necessitates two procedures: information retrieval, which searches for relevant supporting facts, and information synthesis, which integrates these facts into a coherent answer. In this paper, we introduce WebCPM, the first Chinese LFQA dataset. One unique feature of WebCPM is that its information retrieval is based on interactive web search, which engages with a search engine in real time. Following WebGPT, we develop a web search interface. We recruit annotators to search for relevant information using our interface and then answer questions. Meanwhile, the web search behaviors of our annotators would be recorded. In total, we collect 5,500 high-quality question-answer pairs, together with 14,315 supporting facts and 121,330 web search actions. We fine-tune pre-trained language models to imitate human behaviors for web search and to generate answers based on the collected facts. Our LFQA pipeline, built on these fine-tuned models, generates answers that are no worse than human-written ones in 32.5% and 47.5% of the cases on our dataset and DuReader, respectively.

  Ji-Rong Wen",Recommendation as Instruction Following: A Large Language Model Empowered Recommendation Approach,,,,,cs.IR cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In the past decades, recommender systems have attracted much attention in both research and industry communities, and a large number of studies have been devoted to developing effective recommendation models. Basically speaking, these models mainly learn the underlying user preference from historical behavior data, and then estimate the user-item matching relationships for recommendations. Inspired by the recent progress on large language models (LLMs), we take a different approach to developing the recommendation models, considering recommendation as instruction following by LLMs. The key idea is that the preferences or needs of a user can be expressed in natural language descriptions (called instructions), so that LLMs can understand and further execute the instruction for fulfilling the recommendation task. Instead of using public APIs of LLMs, we instruction tune an open-source LLM (3B Flan-T5-XL), in order to better adapt LLMs to recommender systems. For this purpose, we first design a general instruction format for describing the preference, intention, task form and context of a user in natural language. Then we manually design 39 instruction templates and automatically generate a large amount of user-personalized instruction data (252K instructions) with varying types of preferences and intentions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate the instruction templates into several widely-studied recommendation (or search) tasks, and conduct extensive experiments on these tasks with real-world datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed approach can outperform several competitive baselines, including the powerful GPT-3.5, on these evaluation tasks. Our approach sheds light on developing more user-friendly recommender systems, in which users can freely communicate with the system and obtain more accurate recommendations via natural language instructions.

We conduct comprehensive evaluations on 7 typical benchmarks related to reasoning, understanding, and generation tasks, covering both high-resource and low-resource languages. Experimental results show that XLT not only remarkably enhances the performance of various multilingual tasks but also significantly reduces the gap between the average performance and the best performance of each task in different languages. Notably, XLT brings over 10 points of average improvement in arithmetic reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks.

Despite the impressive emerging ability of ChatGPT in various NLP tasks, it is unclear how well ChatGPT performs in causal reasoning. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the ChatGPT's causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal interpreter. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning, possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT's upgrading processes, such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Though (COT) techniques can further exacerbate such causal hallucination. Additionally, the causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than open-ended prompts. For events in sentences, ChatGPT excels at capturing explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in sentences with lower event density and smaller lexical distance between events.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further revolutionized the IR field by enabling users to interact with search systems in natural language. In this paper, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs and SEs, highlighting their respective strengths in understanding user-issued queries and retrieving up-to-date information. To leverage the benefits of both paradigms while circumventing their limitations, we propose InteR, a novel framework that facilitates knowledge refinement through interaction between SEs and LLMs. InteR allows SEs to expand knowledge in queries using LLM-generated knowledge collections and enables LLMs to enhance prompt formulation using SE-retrieved documents. This iterative refinement process augments the inputs of SEs and LLMs, leading to more accurate retrieval. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks demonstrate that InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that LLMs may contain social prejudices, and therefore, the fairness of recommendations made by RecLLM requires further investigation. To avoid the potential risks of RecLLM, it is imperative to evaluate the fairness of RecLLM with respect to various sensitive attributes on the user side. Due to the differences between the RecLLM paradigm and the traditional recommendation paradigm, it is problematic to directly use the fairness benchmark of traditional recommendation. To address the dilemma, we propose a novel benchmark called Fairness of Recommendation via LLM (FaiRLLM). This benchmark comprises carefully crafted metrics and a dataset that accounts for eight sensitive attributes1 in two recommendation scenarios: music and movies. By utilizing our FaiRLLM benchmark, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT and discovered that it still exhibits unfairness to some sensitive attributes when generating recommendations.

Past research also shows that Dualism emerges, in part, via learning (e.g., Barlev & Shtulman, 2021). But whether learning is sufficient to give rise to Dualism is unknown.The evidence from human learners does address this question because humans are endowed not only with general learning capacities but also with core knowledge capacities. And recent results suggest that core knowledge begets Dualism (Berent, Theodore & Valencia, 2021; Berent, 2023). To evaluate the role of learning, here, we probe for a mind-body divide in Davinci--a large language model (LLM) that is devoid of any innate core knowledge. We show that Davinci still leans towards Dualism, and that this bias increases systematically with the learner's inductive potential. Thus, davinci (a GPT-3 model) exhibits mild Dualist tendencies, whereas its descendent, text-davinci-003 (a GPT-3.5 model), shows a full-blown bias. It selectively considers thoughts (epistemic states) as disembodied--as unlikely to show up in the body (in the brain), but not in its absence (after death). While Davinci's performance is constrained by its syntactic limitations, and it differs from humans, its Dualist bias is robust. These results demonstrate that the mind-body divide is partly learnable from experience.They also show how, as LLM's are exposed to human narratives, they induce not only human knowledge but also human biases.

Although plenty of endeavors have been dedicated to building valuable benchmarks, there is still little work aiming at evaluating the capability of LLM in multistep interactive environments. Noticing that LLM requires a text representation of the environment observations for interaction, we choose to fill such a blank by building a novel benchmark based on the information user interface (InfoUI). InfoUI consists of rich text contents and can be represented in some text formats, thus is suitable for the assessment of interaction ability of LLM. Additionally, the complex structures of InfoUI can further raise a challenge for LLM to understand structured texts rather than plain texts. An interaction platform is always used to evaluate an agent, however, there is still a lack of a satisfactory interaction platform dedicated to InfoUI. Consequently, we propose to build a novel easily-extendable, adaptable, and close-to-reality interaction platform, Mobile-Env, to provide a base for an appropriate benchmark. Based on Mobile-Env, an InfoUI task set WikiHow is then built to establish a benchmark for the multistep interaction capability of LLM in structured text-based environments. Agents based on a series of LLMs are tested on the task set to obtain an insight into the potential and challenge of LLM for InfoUI interaction. It is sincerely welcome that the community contribute new environments and new task sets for Mobile-Env to provide better test benchmarks and facilitate the development of the corresponding domains.

However, manual annotation is still necessary for complex pragmatic and discursive features that lack a direct mapping to lexical forms. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the scalability of function-to-form approaches in corpus linguistics. To address this, our study explores automating pragma-discursive corpus annotation using large language models (LLMs). We compare ChatGPT, the Bing chatbot, and a human coder in annotating apology components in English based on the local grammar framework. We find that the Bing chatbot outperformed ChatGPT, with accuracy approaching that of a human coder. These results suggest that AI can be successfully deployed to aid pragma-discursive corpus annotation, making the process more efficient and scalable.

The answer list is required to cover all reasonable answers. This presents the considerable challenges of producing diverse answers and ranking them properly. Incorporating a variety of closely-related background knowledge into the encoding of questions enables the generation of different answers. Meanwhile, learning to distinguish positive answers from negative ones potentially enhances the probabilistic estimation of plausibility, and accordingly, the plausibility-based ranking. Therefore, we propose a Knowledge Enhancement and Plausibility Ranking (KEPR) approach grounded on the Generate-Then-Rank pipeline architecture. Specifically, we expand questions in terms of Wiktionary commonsense knowledge of keywords, and reformulate them with normalized patterns. Dense passage retrieval is utilized for capturing relevant knowledge, and different PLM-based (BART, GPT2 and T5) networks are used for generating answers. On the other hand, we develop an ELECTRA-based answer ranking model, where logistic regression is conducted during training, with the aim of approximating different levels of plausibility in a polar classification scenario. Extensive experiments on the benchmark ProtoQA show that KEPR obtains substantial improvements, compared to the strong baselines. Within the experimental models, the T5-based GenCQA with KEPR obtains the best performance, which is up to 60.91% at the primary canonical metric Inc@3. It outperforms the existing GenCQA models on the current leaderboard of ProtoQA.

This study investigates ChatGPT's capabilities in three dialogue discourse tasks: topic segmentation, discourse relation recognition, and discourse parsing, of varying difficulty levels. To adapt ChatGPT to these tasks, we propose discriminative and generative paradigms and introduce the Chain of Thought (COT) approach to improve ChatGPT's performance in more difficult tasks. The results show that our generative paradigm allows ChatGPT to achieve comparative performance in the topic segmentation task comparable to state-of-the-art methods but reveals room for improvement in the more complex tasks of discourse relation recognition and discourse parsing. Notably, the COT can significantly enhance ChatGPT's performance with the help of understanding complex structures in more challenging tasks. Through a series of case studies, our in-depth analysis suggests that ChatGPT can be a good annotator in topic segmentation but has difficulties understanding complex rhetorical structures. We hope these findings provide a foundation for future research to refine dialogue discourse analysis approaches in the era of LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 15 May 2023 07:14:41 GMT'}]",2023-05-16,"[['Fan', 'Yaxin', ''], ['Jiang', 'Feng', '']]",1,1,2023-05-15,1,2,1,1,0,1,932584bc29b6b80ed0978700f4ea2677f2257d9f,258686248.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/932584bc29b6b80ed0978700f4ea2677f2257d9f,arXiv.org,2023.0,35.0,3.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2115701764', 'name': 'Yaxin Fan'}, {'authorId': '145875191', 'name': 'Feng Jiang'}]","['Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen', 'Soochow University']",['China'],2023-05

As a result, such approaches fall short when applied to dynamic scenarios or domains, whereas a new type of knowledge emerges. This necessitates a system that can handle evolving schema automatically to extract information for KGC. To address this need, we propose a new task called schema-adaptable KGC, which aims to continually extract entity, relation, and event based on a dynamically changing schema graph without re-training. We first split and convert existing datasets based on three principles to build a benchmark, i.e., horizontal schema expansion, vertical schema expansion, and hybrid schema expansion; then investigate the schema-adaptable performance of several well-known approaches such as Text2Event, TANL, UIE and GPT-3.5. We further propose a simple yet effective baseline dubbed AdaKGC, which contains schema-enriched prefix instructor and schema-conditioned dynamic decoding to better handle evolving schema. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that AdaKGC can outperform baselines but still have room for improvement. We hope the proposed work can deliver benefits to the community.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm dubbed Knowledge Rumination to help the pre-trained language model utilize those related latent knowledge without retrieving them from the external corpus. By simply adding a prompt like ``As far as I know'' to the PLMs, we try to review related latent knowledge and inject them back to the model for knowledge consolidation. We apply the proposed knowledge rumination to various language models, including RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-3 and OPT. Experimental results on six commonsense reasoning tasks and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which further proves that the knowledge stored in PLMs can be better exploited to enhance the downstream performance.

Along this line of research, this work aims to investigate the capacity of LLMs that act as the ranking model for recommender systems. To conduct our empirical study, we first formalize the recommendation problem as a conditional ranking task, considering sequential interaction histories as conditions and the items retrieved by the candidate generation model as candidates. We adopt a specific prompting approach to solving the ranking task by LLMs: we carefully design the prompting template by including the sequential interaction history, the candidate items, and the ranking instruction. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets for recommender systems and derive several key findings for the use of LLMs in recommender systems. We show that LLMs have promising zero-shot ranking abilities, even competitive to or better than conventional recommendation models on candidates retrieved by multiple candidate generators. We also demonstrate that LLMs struggle to perceive the order of historical interactions and can be affected by biases like position bias, while these issues can be alleviated via specially designed prompting and bootstrapping strategies.

Thus, detecting generated text is crucial. However, passive detection methods are stuck in domain specificity and limited adversarial robustness. To achieve reliable detection, a watermark-based method was proposed for white-box LLMs, allowing them to embed watermarks during text generation. The method involves randomly dividing the model vocabulary to obtain a special list and adjusting the probability distribution to promote the selection of words in the list. A detection algorithm aware of the list can identify the watermarked text. However, this method is not applicable in many real-world scenarios where only black-box language models are available. For instance, third-parties that develop API-based vertical applications cannot watermark text themselves because API providers only supply generated text and withhold probability distributions to shield their commercial interests. To allow third-parties to autonomously inject watermarks into generated text, we develop a watermarking framework for black-box language model usage scenarios. Specifically, we first define a binary encoding function to compute a random binary encoding corresponding to a word. The encodings computed for non-watermarked text conform to a Bernoulli distribution, wherein the probability of a word representing bit-1 being approximately 0.5. To inject a watermark, we alter the distribution by selectively replacing words representing bit-0 with context-based synonyms that represent bit-1. A statistical test is then used to identify the watermark. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both Chinese and English datasets. Furthermore, results under re-translation, polishing, word deletion, and synonym substitution attacks reveal that it is arduous to remove the watermark without compromising the original semantics.

While instruction tuning offers advantages for facilitating the adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks as a fine-tuning approach, training models with tens of millions or even billions of parameters on large amounts of data results in unaffordable computational costs. To address this, we focus on reducing the data used in LLM instruction tuning to decrease training costs and improve data efficiency, dubbed as Low Training Data Instruction Tuning (LTD Instruction Tuning). Specifically, this paper conducts a preliminary exploration into reducing the data used in LLM training and identifies several observations regarding task specialization for LLM training, such as the optimization of performance for a specific task, the number of instruction types required for instruction tuning, and the amount of data required for task-specific models. The results suggest that task-specific models can be trained using less than 0.5% of the original dataset, with a 2% improvement in performance over those trained on full task-related data.

There is a growing interest in using learning-based techniques for automated GUI testing which aims at generating human-like actions and interactions. However, the limitations such as low testing coverage, weak generalization, and heavy reliance on training data, make an urgent need for a more effective approach to generate human-like actions to thoroughly test mobile apps. Inspired by the success of the Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., GPT-3 and ChatGPT, in natural language understanding and question answering, we formulate the mobile GUI testing problem as a Q&A task. We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process. Within it, we extract the static context of the GUI page and the dynamic context of the iterative testing process, design prompts for inputting this information to LLM, and develop a neural matching network to decode the LLM's output into actionable steps to execute the app. We evaluate GPTDroid on 86 apps from Google Play, and its activity coverage is 71%, with 32% higher than the best baseline, and can detect 36% more bugs with faster speed than the best baseline. GPTDroid also detects 48 new bugs on the Google Play with 25 of them being confirmed/fixed. We further summarize the capabilities of GPTDroid behind the superior performance, including semantic text input, compound action, long meaningful test trace, and test case prioritization.

In our approach, we construct the specialized function to collect relevant evidence from structured data (\ie \emph{reading}), and let LLMs concentrate the reasoning task based on the collected information (\ie \emph{reasoning}). Specially, we propose an \emph{invoking-linearization-generation} procedure to support LLMs in reasoning on the structured data with the help of the external interfaces. By iterating this procedures with provided interfaces, our approach can gradually approach the target answer to a given query. Extensive experiments conducted on three types of structured data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which can significantly boost the performance of ChatGPT and achieve comparable performance against the full-data supervised-tuning baselines.

This paper introduces SpecInfer, an LLM serving system that accelerates generative LLM inference with speculative inference and token tree verification. A key insight behind Specinfer is to combine various collectively boost-tuned small language models to jointly predict the LLM's outputs; the predictions are organized as a token tree, whose nodes each represent a candidate token sequence. The correctness of all candidate token sequences represented by a token tree is verified against the LLM in parallel using a novel tree-based parallel decoding mechanism. SpecInfer uses an LLM as a token tree verifier instead of an incremental decoder, which significantly reduces the end-to-end latency and computational requirement for serving generative LLMs while provably preserving model quality. Our evaluation shows that SpecInfer outperforms existing LLM serving systems by 1.3-2.4x for distributed LLM inference and by 2.6-3.5x for offloading-based LLM inference, while preserving the same generative performance.

However, the cost of running these PLMs may be prohibitive. Furthermore, PLMs may not be open-sourced due to commercial considerations and potential risks of misuse, such as GPT-3. The parameters and gradients of PLMs are unavailable in this scenario. To solve the issue, black-box tuning has been proposed, which utilizes derivative-free optimization (DFO), instead of gradient descent, for training task-specific continuous prompts. However, these gradient-free methods still exhibit a significant gap compared to gradient-based methods. In this paper, we introduce gradient descent into black-box tuning scenario through knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we propose a novel method GDFO, which integrates gradient descent and derivative-free optimization to optimize task-specific continuous prompts in a harmonized manner. Experimental results show that GDFO can achieve significant performance gains over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Protecting the Copyright of Large Language Models for EaaS via Backdoor Watermark,Accepted by ACL 2023,,,,cs.CL cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in both text understanding and generation. Companies have begun to offer Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on these LLMs, which can benefit various natural language processing (NLP) tasks for customers. However, previous studies have shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which can cause significant losses for the owners of LLMs, as training these models is extremely expensive. To protect the copyright of LLMs for EaaS, we propose an Embedding Watermark method called EmbMarker that implants backdoors on embeddings. Our method selects a group of moderate-frequency words from a general text corpus to form a trigger set, then selects a target embedding as the watermark, and inserts it into the embeddings of texts containing trigger words as the backdoor. The weight of insertion is proportional to the number of trigger words included in the text. This allows the watermark backdoor to be effectively transferred to EaaS-stealer's model for copyright verification while minimizing the adverse impact on the original embeddings' utility. Our extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method can effectively protect the copyright of EaaS models without compromising service quality.

While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

Although ChatGPT has been integrated into the overall workflow to boost efficiency in many domains, the lack of flexibility in the finetuning process hinders its applications in areas that demand extensive domain expertise and semantic knowledge, such as healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate ChatGPT on the China National Medical Licensing Examination (CNMLE) and propose a novel approach to improve ChatGPT from two perspectives: integrating medical domain knowledge and enabling few-shot learning. By using a simple but effective retrieval method, medical background knowledge is extracted as semantic instructions to guide the inference of ChatGPT. Similarly, relevant medical questions are identified and fed as demonstrations to ChatGPT. Experimental results show that directly applying ChatGPT fails to qualify the CNMLE at a score of 51 (i.e., only 51\% of questions are answered correctly). While our knowledge-enhanced model achieves a high score of 70 on CNMLE-2022 which not only passes the qualification but also surpasses the average score of humans (61).

However, with their widespread deployment, there is a general lack of research that thoroughly discusses and analyzes the potential risks concealed. In that case, we intend to conduct a preliminary but pioneering study covering the robustness, consistency, and credibility of LLMs systems. With most of the related literature in the era of LLM uncharted, we propose an automated workflow that copes with an upscaled number of queries/responses. Overall, we conduct over a million queries to the mainstream LLMs including ChatGPT, LLaMA, and OPT. Core to our workflow consists of a data primitive, followed by an automated interpreter that evaluates these LLMs under different adversarial metrical systems. As a result, we draw several, and perhaps unfortunate, conclusions that are quite uncommon from this trendy community. Briefly, they are: (i)-the minor but inevitable error occurrence in the user-generated query input may, by chance, cause the LLM to respond unexpectedly; (ii)-LLMs possess poor consistency when processing semantically similar query input. In addition, as a side finding, we find that ChatGPT is still capable to yield the correct answer even when the input is polluted at an extreme level. While this phenomenon demonstrates the powerful memorization of the LLMs, it raises serious concerns about using such data for LLM-involved evaluation in academic development. To deal with it, we propose a novel index associated with a dataset that roughly decides the feasibility of using such data for LLM-involved evaluation. Extensive empirical studies are tagged to support the aforementioned claims.

Comprehensively evaluating the capability of large language models in multiple tasks is of great importance. In this paper, we propose M3KE, a Massive Multi-Level Multi-Subject Knowledge Evaluation benchmark, which is developed to measure knowledge acquired by Chinese large language models by testing their multitask accuracy in zero- and few-shot settings. We have collected 20,477 questions from 71 tasks. Our selection covers all major levels of Chinese education system, ranging from the primary school to college, as well as a wide variety of subjects, including humanities, history, politics, law, education, psychology, science, technology, art and religion. All questions are multiple-choice questions with four options, hence guaranteeing a standardized and unified assessment process. We've assessed a number of state-of-the-art open-source Chinese large language models on the proposed benchmark. The size of these models varies from 335M to 130B parameters. Experiment results demonstrate that they perform significantly worse than GPT-3.5 that reaches an accuracy of ~ 48% on M3KE. The dataset is available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/M3KE.

We propose a benchmark named Natural Language Planning and Action (Natala) composed of a set of novel tasks: Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulations, and Natural Language Navigation. We found that current popular LLMs such as ChatGPT still lack abilities in complex planning. This arises a question -- do the LLMs have a good understanding of the environments described in natural language, or maybe other alternatives such as symbolic representations are neater and hence better to be understood by LLMs? To this end, we propose a novel method called CoS (Chain-of-Symbol Prompting) that represents the complex environments with condensed symbolic spatial representations during the chained intermediate thinking steps. CoS is easy to use and does not need additional training on LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that CoS clearly surpasses the performance of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting in all three planning tasks with even fewer tokens used in the inputs compared with CoT on ChatGPT and InstructGPT. The performance gain is strong, by up to 60.8% accuracy (from 31.8% to 92.6%) on Brick World for ChatGPT. CoS also reduces the number of tokens in the prompt obviously, by up to 65.8% of the tokens (from 407 to 139) for the intermediate steps from demonstrations on Brick World.

  Wen",Evaluating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models,Work in progress,,,,cs.CV cs.CL cs.MM,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Inspired by the superior language abilities of large language models (LLM), large vision-language models (LVLM) have been recently explored by integrating powerful LLMs for improving the performance on complex multimodal tasks. Despite the promising progress on LVLMs, we find that LVLMs suffer from the hallucination problem, i.e. they tend to generate objects that are inconsistent with the target images in the descriptions. To investigate it, this work presents the first systematic study on object hallucination of LVLMs. We conduct the evaluation experiments on several representative LVLMs, and show that they mostly suffer from severe object hallucination issue. We further discuss that the visual instructions may influence the hallucination, and find that: objects that frequently occur in the visual instructions or co-occur with the image objects, are obviously prone to be hallucinated by LVLMs. Besides, we find that existing evaluation methods might be affected by the input instructions and generation styles of LVLMs. Thus, we further design an improved evaluation method for object hallucination by proposing a polling-based query method called POPE. Experiment results demonstrate that our POPE can evaluate the object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way. Our codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/POPE.

Considering that text is the most important record for scientific discovery, in this paper, we propose MolXPT, a unified language model of text and molecules pre-trained on SMILES (a sequence representation of molecules) wrapped by text. Briefly, we detect the molecule names in each sequence and replace them to the corresponding SMILES. In this way, the SMILES could leverage the information from surrounding text, and vice versa.

In this paper, we consider developing a VLP model in the medical domain for making computer-aided diagnoses (CAD) based on image scans and text descriptions in electronic health records, as done in practice. To achieve our goal, we present a lightweight CAD system MedBLIP, a new paradigm for bootstrapping VLP from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. We design a MedQFormer module to bridge the gap between 3D medical images and 2D pre-trained image encoders and language models as well. To evaluate the effectiveness of our MedBLIP, we collect more than 30,000 image volumes from five public Alzheimer's disease (AD) datasets, i.e., ADNI, NACC, OASIS, AIBL, and MIRIAD. On this largest AD dataset we know, our model achieves the SOTA performance on the zero-shot classification of healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subjects, and shows its capability of making medical visual question answering (VQA).

It offers several advantages, including the ability to distinguish between real and generated images, evaluate text-image alignment, and assess image aesthetics without requiring model training or fine-tuning. X-IQE is more cost-effective and efficient compared to human evaluation, while significantly enhancing the transparency and explainability of deep image quality evaluation models. We validate the effectiveness of our method as a benchmark using images generated by prevalent diffusion models.

However, it is crucial to address the potential misuse of these models, which can lead to detrimental outcomes such as plagiarism and spamming. Recently, several detectors have been proposed, including fine-tuned classifiers and various statistical methods. In this study, we reveal that with the aid of carefully crafted prompts, LLMs can effectively evade these detection systems. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically generate such prompts. On three real-world tasks where LLMs can be misused, SICO successfully enables ChatGPT to evade six existing detectors, causing a significant 0.54 AUC drop on average. Surprisingly, in most cases these detectors perform even worse than random classifiers. These results firmly reveal the vulnerability of existing detectors. Finally, the strong performance of SICO suggests itself as a reliable evaluation protocol for any new detector in this field.

However, as such knowledge is frozen at the time of model training, the models become static and limited by the training data at that time. In order to further improve the capacity of LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks, we consider augmenting LLMs with the large-scale web using search engine. Unlike previous augmentation sources (e.g., Wikipedia data dump), the web provides broader, more comprehensive and constantly updated information. In this paper, we present a web-augmented LLM UNIWEB, which is trained over 16 knowledge-intensive tasks in a unified text-to-text format. Instead of simply using the retrieved contents from web, our approach has made two major improvements. Firstly, we propose an adaptive search engine assisted learning method that can self-evaluate the confidence level of LLM's predictions, and adaptively determine when to refer to the web for more data, which can avoid useless or noisy augmentation from web. Secondly, we design a pretraining task, i.e., continual knowledge learning, based on salient spans prediction, to reduce the discrepancy between the encoded and retrieved knowledge. Experiments on a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks show that our model significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented methods.

We investigate whether LLMs can serve as generalized planners: given a domain and training tasks, generate a program that efficiently produces plans for other tasks in the domain. In particular, we consider PDDL domains and use GPT-4 to synthesize Python programs. We also consider (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization, where the LLM is prompted to summarize the domain and propose a strategy in words before synthesizing the program; and (2) automated debugging, where the program is validated with respect to the training tasks, and in case of errors, the LLM is re-prompted with four types of feedback. We evaluate this approach in seven PDDL domains and compare it to four ablations and four baselines. Overall, we find that GPT-4 is a surprisingly powerful generalized planner. We also conclude that automated debugging is very important, that CoT summarization has non-uniform impact, that GPT-4 is far superior to GPT-3.5, and that just two training tasks are often sufficient for strong generalization.

However, in the field of computer vision, despite the availability of numerous powerful vision foundation models (VFMs), they are still restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form, struggling to match the open-ended task capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we present an LLM-based framework for vision-centric tasks, termed VisionLLM. This framework provides a unified perspective for vision and language tasks by treating images as a foreign language and aligning vision-centric tasks with language tasks that can be flexibly defined and managed using language instructions. An LLM-based decoder can then make appropriate predictions based on these instructions for open-ended tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VisionLLM can achieve different levels of task customization through language instructions, from fine-grained object-level to coarse-grained task-level customization, all with good results. It's noteworthy that, with a generalist LLM-based framework, our model can achieve over 60\% mAP on COCO, on par with detection-specific models.

In response to their fast adoption in many industrial applications, this survey concerns their safety and trustworthiness. First, we review known vulnerabilities and limitations of the LLMs, categorising them into inherent issues, attacks, and unintended bugs. Then, we consider if and how the Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques, which have been widely developed for traditional software and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks as independent processes to check the alignment of their implementations against the specifications, can be integrated and further extended throughout the lifecycle of the LLMs to provide rigorous analysis to the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs and their applications. Specifically, we consider four complementary techniques: falsification and evaluation, verification, runtime monitoring, and regulations and ethical use.

We also examined the challenges of PLMs in urban science research from both technical and social perspectives. The prospects of the application of PLMs in urban science research were then proposed. We found that PLMs can effectively aid in understanding complex concepts in urban science, facilitate urban spatial form identification, assist in disaster monitoring, and sense public sentiment. At the same time, however, the applications of PLMs in urban science research face evident threats, such as technical limitations, security, privacy, and social bias.

The core insight of our method is to fully consider the information propagation among nodes and edges in a graph when building the attention module in the transformer blocks. Specifically, we propose a new attention mechanism called Graph Propagation Attention (GPA). It explicitly passes the information among nodes and edges in three ways, i.e. node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node, which is essential for learning graph-structured data. On this basis, we design an effective transformer architecture named Graph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans) to further help learn graph data. We verify the performance of GPTrans in a wide range of graph learning experiments on several benchmark datasets. These results show that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art transformer-based graph models with better performance. The code will be released at https://github.com/czczup/GPTrans.

Inspired by the advancements of the GPT, we present PointGPT, a novel approach that extends the concept of GPT to point clouds, addressing the challenges associated with disorder properties, low information density, and task gaps. Specifically, a point cloud auto-regressive generation task is proposed to pre-train transformer models. Our method partitions the input point cloud into multiple point patches and arranges them in an ordered sequence based on their spatial proximity. Then, an extractor-generator based transformer decoder, with a dual masking strategy, learns latent representations conditioned on the preceding point patches, aiming to predict the next one in an auto-regressive manner. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, our approach achieves classification accuracies of 94.9% on the ModelNet40 dataset and 93.4% on the ScanObjectNN dataset, outperforming all other transformer models.

However, LLMs face challenges in maintaining factual consistency during reasoning, exhibiting tendencies to condition overlooking, question misinterpretation, and condition hallucination over given problems. Existing methods use coarse-grained feedback (e.g., whether the answer is correct) to improve factual consistency. In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing Chain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities by automatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs, generated solutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct the problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between the original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual inconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT formulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide LLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of RCoT over standard CoT, Self-Consistency and Self-Refine across seven arithmetic datasets. Moreover, we find that manually written fine-grained feedback can dramatically improve LLMs' reasoning abilities (e.g., ChatGPT reaches 94.6% accuracy on GSM8K), encouraging the community to further explore the fine-grained feedback generation methods.

However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior, such as hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive and toxic content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially ""black boxes"" to validate and progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance of external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Fri, 19 May 2023 15:19:44 GMT'}, {'version': 'v2', 'created': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 08:35:29 GMT'}]",2023-10-03,"[['Gou', 'Zhibin', ''], ['Shao', 'Zhihong', ''], ['Gong', 'Yeyun', ''], ['Shen', 'Yelong', ''], ['Yang', 'Yujiu', ''], ['Duan', 'Nan', ''], ['Chen', 'Weizhu', '']]",0,0,2023-05-19,2,7,2,0,0,0,bcdaf6c98ddbd6809cf6241aa77200d7394db163,258823123.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bcdaf6c98ddbd6809cf6241aa77200d7394db163,arXiv.org,2023.0,144.0,41.0,3.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '1797090', 'name': 'Zhibin Gou'}, {'authorId': '144485528', 'name': 'Zhihong Shao'}, {'authorId': '2171182', 'name': 'Yeyun Gong'}, {'authorId': '1752875', 'name': 'Yelong Shen'}, {'authorId': '2108585311', 'name': 'Yujiu Yang'}, {'authorId': '46429989', 'name': 'Nan Duan'}, {'authorId': '2109136147', 'name': 'Weizhu Chen'}]","['Tsinghua University', 'Microsoft']","['China', 'United States']",2023-05

To understand what types of content and to which extent LLMs are apt to hallucinate, we introduce the Hallucination Evaluation for Large Language Models (HaluEval) benchmark, a large collection of generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples for evaluating the performance of LLMs in recognizing hallucination. To generate these samples, we propose a ChatGPT-based two-step framework, \ie sampling-then-filtering. Besides, we also hire some human labelers to annotate the hallucinations in ChatGPT responses. The empirical results suggest that ChatGPT is likely to generate hallucinated content in specific topics by fabricating unverifiable information (\ie about $11.4\%$ user queries). Moreover, existing LLMs face great challenges in recognizing the hallucinations in texts.

Wallace",Appraising the Potential Uses and Harms of LLMs for Medical Systematic Reviews,"34 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables",,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Medical systematic reviews are crucial for informing clinical decision making and healthcare policy. But producing such reviews is onerous and time-consuming. Thus, high-quality evidence synopses are not available for many questions and may be outdated even when they are available. Large language models (LLMs) are now capable of generating long-form texts, suggesting the tantalizing possibility of automatically generating literature reviews on demand. However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially misleading) texts by hallucinating or omitting important information. In the healthcare context, this may render LLMs unusable at best and dangerous at worst. Most discussion surrounding the benefits and risks of LLMs have been divorced from specific applications. In this work, we seek to qualitatively characterize the potential utility and risks of LLMs for assisting in production of medical evidence reviews. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with international experts in systematic reviews, grounding discussion in the context of generating evidence reviews. Domain experts indicated that LLMs could aid writing reviews, as a tool for drafting or creating plain language summaries, generating templates or suggestions, distilling information, crosschecking, and synthesizing or interpreting text inputs. But they also identified issues with model outputs and expressed concerns about potential downstream harms of confidently composed but inaccurate LLM outputs which might mislead. Other anticipated potential downstream harms included lessened accountability and proliferation of automatically generated reviews that might be of low quality. Informed by this qualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation of biomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views.

In our benchmark, which is curated to evaluate MLLMs visual semantic understanding and fine-grained perception capabilities, we discussed different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant methods (i.e., DeiT, CLIP, MAE, DINO), and observe that: i) Fully/weakly supervised models capture more semantics than self-supervised models, but the gap is narrowed by scaling up the pre-training dataset. ii) Self-supervised models are better at fine-grained perception, where patch-level supervision is particularly effective. iii) Tuning the visual tokenizer leads to the loss of semantics obtained from large-scale pretraining, which is unfavorable with relatively small-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Given the findings, we reviewed methods that attempted to unify semantics and fine-grained visual understanding, e.g., patch-level feature distillation with semantically-rich targets. We obtain an intriguing insight mask-based strategies that were once all the rage may not be applicable for obtaining good visual tokenizers. Based on this critical observation, we obtain a new MLLM equipped with a tailored Good Visual Tokenizer (GVT), which exhibits strong visual comprehension capability at multiple scales. In particular, without introducing extra parameters and task-specific fine-tuning, GVT achieves superior performance on visual question answering, image captioning, and other fine-grained visual understanding tasks such as object counting and multi-class identification.

Our approach enables the editing of input videos based on natural language instructions without any per-example fine-tuning or inversion. The proposed InstructVid2Vid model combines a pretrained image generation model, Stable Diffusion, with a conditional 3D U-Net architecture to generate time-dependent sequence of video frames. To obtain the training data, we incorporate the knowledge and expertise of different models, including ChatGPT, BLIP, and Tune-a-Video, to synthesize video-instruction triplets, which is a more cost-efficient alternative to collecting data in real-world scenarios. To improve the consistency between adjacent frames of generated videos, we propose the Frame Difference Loss, which is incorporated during the training process. During inference, we extend the classifier-free guidance to text-video input to guide the generated results, making them more related to both the input video and instruction. Experiments demonstrate that InstructVid2Vid is able to generate high-quality, temporally coherent videos and perform diverse edits, including attribute editing, change of background, and style transfer.

New Outlooks for Low-Bit Quantization on Large Language Models,,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) necessitates low-bit quantization to minimize model size and inference cost. While low-bit integer formats (e.g., INT8/INT4) have been the conventional choice, emerging low-bit floating-point formats (e.g., FP8/FP4) offer a compelling alternative and are gaining support from cutting-edge hardware, such as NVIDIA's H100 GPU. However, the superiority of low-bit INT versus FP formats for quantization on LLMs remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of INT and FP quantization with the same bit-width, revealing that the optimal quantization format varies across different layers due to the complexity and diversity of tensor distribution. Consequently, we advocate the Mixture of Formats Quantization (MoFQ), which selects the optimal format on a layer-wise basis. This simple yet effective approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only (W-only) and weight-activation (WA) post-training quantization scenarios when tested on LLaMA across various tasks. In 4-bit W-only quantization, MoFQ surpasses GPTQ without complex hyperparameter tuning and with an order of magnitude faster quantization speed. While in 8-bit WA quantization, MoFQ significantly outperforms INT/FP-only methods, achieving performance close to the full precision model. Notably, MoFQ incurs no hardware overhead compared to INT/FP-only quantization, as the bit-width remains unchanged.

However, such systems may still produce content containing biases and stereotypes, causing potential social problems. Due to the data-driven, black-box nature of modern AI techniques, comprehensively identifying and measuring biases in conversational systems remains a challenging task. Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehensively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both social groups as well as biased properties. In addition, modern conversational systems can produce diverse responses (e.g., chatting and explanation), which makes existing bias detection methods simply based on the sentiment and the toxicity hardly being adopted. In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, an automated framework to identify and measure social bias in conversational AI systems. To obtain social groups and biased properties, we construct a comprehensive social bias dataset, containing a total of 841 groups and 8,110 biased properties. Given the dataset, BiasAsker automatically generates questions and adopts a novel method based on existence measurement to identify two types of biases (i.e., absolute bias and related bias) in conversational systems. Extensive experiments on 8 commercial systems and 2 famous research models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3, show that 32.83% of the questions generated by BiasAsker can trigger biased behaviors in these widely deployed conversational systems.

To solve the issue, we propose CodeMark, a watermarking system that hides bit strings into variables respecting the natural and operational semantics of the code. For naturalness, we novelly introduce a contextual watermarking scheme to generate watermarked variables more coherent in the context atop graph neural networks. Each variable is treated as a node on the graph and the node feature gathers neighborhood (context) information through learning. Watermarks embedded into the features are thus reflected not only by the variables but also by the local contexts. We further introduce a pre-trained model on source code as a teacher to guide more natural variable generation. Throughout the embedding, the operational semantics are preserved as only variable names are altered. Beyond guaranteeing code-specific properties, CodeMark is superior in watermarking accuracy, capacity, and efficiency due to a more diversified pattern generated.

This paper introduces the GAOKAO-Benchmark (GAOKAO-Bench), an intuitive benchmark that employs questions from the Chinese Gaokao examination as test samples for evaluating large language models.In order to align the evaluation results with humans as much as possible, we designed a method based on zero-shot prompts to analyze the accuracy and scoring rate of the model by dividing the questions into subjective and objective types. We evaluated the ChatGPT model on GAOKAO-Benchmark performance.Our findings reveal that the ChatGPT model excels in tackling objective questions, while also shedding light on its shortcomings and areas for improvement.

Visual relation detection (VRD) is a typical task that identifies relationship (or interaction) types between object pairs within an image. However, naively utilizing CLIP with prevalent class-based prompts for zero-shot VRD has several weaknesses, e.g., it struggles to distinguish between different fine-grained relation types and it neglects essential spatial information of two objects. To this end, we propose a novel method for zero-shot VRD: RECODE, which solves RElation detection via COmposite DEscription prompts. Specifically, RECODE first decomposes each predicate category into subject, object, and spatial components. Then, it leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate description-based prompts (or visual cues) for each component. Different visual cues enhance the discriminability of similar relation categories from different perspectives, which significantly boosts performance in VRD. To dynamically fuse different cues, we further introduce a chain-of-thought method that prompts LLMs to generate reasonable weights for different visual cues. Extensive experiments on four VRD benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and interpretability of RECODE.

Detecting whether a text is machine-generated has thus become increasingly important. While machine-learning-based detection strategies exhibit superior performance, they often lack generalizability, limiting their practicality. In this work, we introduce GPT Paternity Test (GPT-Pat), which reliably detects machine-generated text across varied datasets. Given a text under scrutiny, we leverage ChatGPT to generate a corresponding question and provide a re-answer to the question. By comparing the similarity between the original text and the generated re-answered text, it can be determined whether the text is machine-generated. GPT-Pat consists of a Siamese network to compute the similarity between the original text and the generated re-answered text and a binary classifier. Our method achieved an average accuracy of 94.57% on four generalization test sets, surpassing the state-of-the-art RoBERTa-based method by 12.34%. The accuracy drop of our method is only about half of that of the RoBERTa-based method when it is attacked by re-translation and polishing.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under privacy-restricted scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes. This context serves as additional input for SLMs, augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Our method significantly enhances performance in both few-shot and full training settings across three medical knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving up to a 22.57% increase in absolute accuracy compared to SLM fine-tuning without context, and sets new state-of-the-art results in two medical tasks within privacy-restricted scenarios.

This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT's decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT's decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in the literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are slightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of heterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender, but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of natural language processing tasks. Among them, ChatGPT is the most popular one which has attracted wide attention from the software engineering community. However, it still remains unclear how ChatGPT performs in (automatic) code summarization. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on evaluating ChatGPT on a widely-used Python dataset called CSN-Python and comparing it with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) code summarization models. Specifically, we first explore an appropriate prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate in-distribution comments. Then, we use such a prompt to ask ChatGPT to generate comments for all code snippets in the CSN-Python test set. We adopt three widely-used metrics (including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L) to measure the quality of the comments generated by ChatGPT and SOTA models (including NCS, CodeBERT, and CodeT5). The experimental results show that in terms of BLEU and ROUGE-L, ChatGPT's code summarization performance is significantly worse than all three SOTA models.

  Tian, Qixiang Ye, Li Yuan",Album Storytelling with Iterative Story-aware Captioning and Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This work studies how to transform an album to vivid and coherent stories, a task we refer to as ""album storytelling"". While this task can help preserve memories and facilitate experience sharing, it remains an underexplored area in current literature. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is now possible to generate lengthy, coherent text, opening up the opportunity to develop an AI assistant for album storytelling. One natural approach is to use caption models to describe each photo in the album, and then use LLMs to summarize and rewrite the generated captions into an engaging story. However, we find this often results in stories containing hallucinated information that contradicts the images, as each generated caption (""story-agnostic"") is not always about the description related to the whole story or miss some necessary information. To address these limitations, we propose a new iterative album storytelling pipeline. Specifically, we start with an initial story and build a story-aware caption model to refine the captions using the whole story as guidance. The polished captions are then fed into the LLMs to generate a new refined story. This process is repeated iteratively until the story contains minimal factual errors while maintaining coherence. To evaluate our proposed pipeline, we introduce a new dataset of image collections from vlogs and a set of systematic evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that our method effectively generates more accurate and engaging stories for albums, with enhanced coherence and vividness.

Existing methods are dominated by training models with parallel image-text pairs, which are very costly to collect. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore TBPS without parallel image-text data ($\mu$-TBPS), in which only non-parallel images and texts, or even image-only data, can be adopted. Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner. In the generation stage, we propose a fine-grained image captioning strategy to obtain an enriched description of the person image, which firstly utilizes a set of instruction prompts to activate the off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language model to capture and generate fine-grained person attributes, and then converts the extracted attributes into a textual description via the finetuned large language model or the hand-crafted template. In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training. Experimental results on multiple TBPS benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid) show that the proposed GTR can achieve a promising performance without relying on parallel image-text data.

However, the ICL models that can solve ordinary cases are hardly extended to solve more complex tasks by processing the demonstration examples once. This single-turn ICL is incoordinate with the decision making process of humans by learning from analogy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs by exploiting a dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent-based optimization. Concretely, we divide the ICL process into ""Deep-Thinking"" and inference stages. The ""Deep-Thinking"" stage performs iterative forward optimization of demonstrations, which is expected to boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs at test time by ""thinking"" demonstrations multiple times. It produces accumulated meta-gradients by manipulating the Key-Value matrices in the self-attention modules of the Transformer. Then, the inference stage only takes the test query as input without concatenating demonstrations and applies the learned meta-gradients through attention for output prediction. In this way, demonstrations are not required during the inference stage since they are already learned and stored in the definitive meta-gradients. LLMs can be effectively and efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten classification and multiple-choice datasets show that our method achieves substantially better performance than standard ICL in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

We collect training data for these tasks, reframe them in an instruction-following format, and subsequently refine LLaMa via instruction tuning. Experimental results show that continually fine-tuning LLaMa on writing instruction data significantly improves its ability on writing tasks. We also conduct more experiments and analyses to offer insights for future work on effectively fine-tuning LLaMa for specific scenarios.

These models show powerful capabilities across a wide range of content, including news article writing, story generation, and scientific writing. Such capability further narrows the gap between human-authored and machine-generated texts, highlighting the importance of deepfake text detection to avoid potential risks such as fake news propagation and plagiarism. However, previous work has been limited in that they testify methods on testbed of specific domains or certain language models. In practical scenarios, the detector faces texts from various domains or LLMs without knowing their sources. To this end, we build a wild testbed by gathering texts from various human writings and deepfake texts generated by different LLMs. Human annotators are only slightly better than random guessing at identifying machine-generated texts. Empirical results on automatic detection methods further showcase the challenges of deepfake text detection in a wild testbed. In addition, out-of-distribution poses a greater challenge for a detector to be employed in realistic application scenarios. We release our resources at https://github.com/yafuly/DeepfakeTextDetect.

However, it sometimes shows insufficient reasoning ability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) emerge with powerful reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we propose a method called TReE, which transfers the reasoning ability of a large language model to a visual language model in zero-shot scenarios. TReE contains three stages: observation, thinking, and re-thinking. Observation stage indicates that VLM obtains the overall information of the relative image. Thinking stage combines the image information and task description as the prompt of the LLM, inference with the rationals. Re-Thinking stage learns from rationale and then inference the final result through VLM.

It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.

However, existing video understanding models are often task-specific and lack a comprehensive capability of handling diverse tasks. The success of large language models (LLMs) like GPT has demonstrated their impressive abilities in sequence causal reasoning. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel framework called VideoLLM that leverages the sequence reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs from natural language processing (NLP) for video sequence understanding. VideoLLM incorporates a carefully designed Modality Encoder and Semantic Translator, which convert inputs from various modalities into a unified token sequence. This token sequence is then fed into a decoder-only LLM. Subsequently, with the aid of a simple task head, our VideoLLM yields an effective unified framework for different kinds of video understanding tasks. To evaluate the efficacy of VideoLLM, we conduct extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and fine-tuning methods. We evaluate our VideoLLM on eight tasks sourced from four different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively transferred to video understanding tasks.

As the most mainstream datasets for the news sub-domain, CNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum have been widely used for performance benchmarking. However, the reference summaries of those datasets turn out to be noisy, mainly in terms of factual hallucination and information redundancy. To address this challenge, we first annotate new expert-writing Element-aware test sets following the ""Lasswell Communication Model"" proposed by Lasswell (1948), allowing reference summaries to focus on more fine-grained news elements objectively and comprehensively. Utilizing the new test sets, we observe the surprising zero-shot summary ability of LLMs, which addresses the issue of the inconsistent results between human preference and automatic evaluation metrics of LLMs' zero-shot summaries in prior work. Further, we propose a Summary Chain-of-Thought (SumCoT) technique to elicit LLMs to generate summaries step by step, which helps them integrate more fine-grained details of source documents into the final summaries that correlate with the human writing mindset.

Inspired by recent successes of large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding, tremendous progress has been made by treating programming language as another sort of natural language and training LLMs on corpora of program code. However, programs are essentially different from texts after all, in a sense that they are normally heavily structured and syntax-strict. In particular, programs and their basic units (i.e., functions and subroutines) are designed to demonstrate a variety of behaviors and/or provide possible outputs, given different inputs. The relationship between inputs and possible outputs/behaviors represents the functions/subroutines and profiles the program as a whole. Therefore, we propose to incorporate such a relationship into learning, for achieving a deeper semantic understanding of programs. To obtain inputs that are representative enough to trigger the execution of most part of the code, we resort to fuzz testing and propose fuzz tuning to boost the performance of program understanding and code representation learning, given a pre-trained LLM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on two program understanding tasks including code clone detection and code classification, and it outperforms current state-of-the-arts by large margins.

However, they neglect the possibility that user inputs may inherently contain incorrect information due to users' false beliefs or malicious intents. In this way, blindly adhering to users' false content will cause deception and harm. To address this problem, we propose a challenging benchmark consisting of Inductive Instructions (INDust) to evaluate whether LLMs could resist these instructions. The INDust includes 15K instructions across three categories: Fact-Checking Instructions, Questions based on False Premises, and Creative Instructions based on False Premises. Our experiments on several strong LLMs reveal that current LLMs can be easily deceived by INDust into generating misleading and malicious statements. Hence we employ Self-Critique prompting to encourage LLMs to not only critique themselves like in previous works but also the users, which show remarkable improvement in handling inductive instructions under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Such prior potentially impacts many vision tasks. For example, in conditional image synthesis, spatial conditions failing to adhere to the prior can result in visually inaccurate synthetic results. This work aims to explicitly learn the visual prior and enable the customization of sampling. Inspired by advances in language modeling, we propose to learn Visual prior via Generative Pre-Training, dubbed VisorGPT. By discretizing visual locations of objects, e.g., bounding boxes, human pose, and instance masks, into sequences, VisorGPT can model visual prior through likelihood maximization. Besides, prompt engineering is investigated to unify various visual locations and enable customized sampling of sequential outputs from the learned prior. Experimental results demonstrate that VisorGPT can effectively model the visual prior, which can be employed for many vision tasks, such as customizing accurate human pose for conditional image synthesis models like ControlNet.

One practical area of research is to treat these models as black boxes and interact with them through their inference APIs. In this paper, we investigate how to optimize few-shot text classification without accessing the gradients of the LLMs. To achieve this, we treat the black-box model as a feature extractor and train a classifier with the augmented text data. Data augmentation is performed using prompt-based finetuning on an auxiliary language model with a much smaller parameter size than the black-box model. Through extensive experiments on eight text classification datasets, we show that our approach, dubbed BT-Classifier, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art black-box few-shot learners and performs on par with methods that rely on full-model tuning.

Previous studies acquire specialized skills through distillation on LLMs, which result in trading generic abilities, called model specialization. As for reasoning ability, chain-of-thought was synthesized to subsequent distillation. However, due to hallucination, synthetic chain-of-thought from LLMs contains faulty reasoning. These incorrect reasoning steps damage the reasoning capability. To tackle above issues, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which distills LLMs to obtain specialized small models in reasoning tasks. In PaD, we strengthen specialized models with program-aided reasoning, and help them overcome faulty reasoning steps with automated error checking. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the GSM8K benchmark, a 0.06B model using PaD can not only outperform certain LLMs (e.g., LLaMA), but also achieves a 10% improvement over baselines with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data. Data pruning analysis reveals that PaD possesses higher training efficiency.

Due to the large scale of KB, annotated data is impossible to cover all fact schemas in KB, which poses a challenge to the generalization ability of methods that require a sufficient amount of annotated data. Recently, LLMs have shown strong few-shot performance in many NLP tasks. We expect LLM can help existing methods improve their generalization ability, especially in low-resource situations. In this paper, we present McL-KBQA, a framework that incorporates the few-shot ability of LLM into the KBQA method via ICL-based multiple choice and then improves the effectiveness of the QA tasks. Experimental results on two KBQA datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of McL-KBQA with strong improvements in generalization. We expect to explore a new way to QA tasks from KBQA in conjunction with LLM, how to generate answers normatively and correctly with strong generalization.

However, most prior evaluation benchmarks have been devoted to validating pairwise matching correctness, ignoring the crucial measurement of robustness. In this paper, we present the first benchmark that simulates the evaluation of open information extraction models in the real world, where the syntactic and expressive distributions under the same knowledge meaning may drift variously. We design and annotate a large-scale testbed in which each example is a knowledge-invariant clique that consists of sentences with structured knowledge of the same meaning but with different syntactic and expressive forms. By further elaborating the robustness metric, a model is judged to be robust if its performance is consistently accurate on the overall cliques. We perform experiments on typical models published in the last decade as well as a popular large language model, the results show that the existing successful models exhibit a frustrating degradation, with a maximum drop of 23.43 F1 score.

To estimate the potential of the hardware design process assisted by LLMs, this work attempts to demonstrate an automated design environment that explores LLMs to generate hardware logic designs from natural language specifications. To realize a more accessible and efficient chip development flow, we present a scalable four-stage zero-code logic design framework based on LLMs without retraining or finetuning. At first, the demo, ChipGPT, begins by generating prompts for the LLM, which then produces initial Verilog programs. Second, an output manager corrects and optimizes these programs before collecting them into the final design space. Eventually, ChipGPT will search through this space to select the optimal design under the target metrics. The evaluation sheds some light on whether LLMs can generate correct and complete hardware logic designs described by natural language for some specifications. It is shown that ChipGPT improves programmability, and controllability, and shows broader design optimization space compared to prior work and native LLMs alone.

However, it is not yet clear whether LMs can understand physical concepts in the human world. To investigate this, we design a benchmark VEC that covers the tasks of (i) Visual concepts, such as the shape and material of objects, and (ii) Embodied Concepts, learned from the interaction with the world such as the temperature of objects. Our zero (few)-shot prompting results show that the understanding of certain visual concepts emerges as scaling up LMs, but there are still basic concepts to which the scaling law does not apply. For example, OPT-175B performs close to humans with a zero-shot accuracy of 85\% on the material concept, yet behaves like random guessing on the mass concept. Instead, vision-augmented LMs such as CLIP and BLIP achieve a human-level understanding of embodied concepts. Analysis indicates that the rich semantics in visual representation can serve as a valuable source of embodied knowledge. Inspired by this, we propose a distillation method to transfer embodied knowledge from VLMs to LMs, achieving performance gain comparable with that by scaling up the parameters of LMs 134x.

  Lewei Yao, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Lingpeng Kong, Tong Zhang",DetGPT: Detect What You Need via Reasoning,,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In recent years, the field of computer vision has seen significant advancements thanks to the development of large language models (LLMs). These models have enabled more effective and sophisticated interactions between humans and machines, paving the way for novel techniques that blur the lines between human and machine intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for object detection that we call reasoning-based object detection. Unlike conventional object detection methods that rely on specific object names, our approach enables users to interact with the system using natural language instructions, allowing for a higher level of interactivity. Our proposed method, called DetGPT, leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal models and open-vocabulary object detectors to perform reasoning within the context of the user's instructions and the visual scene. This enables DetGPT to automatically locate the object of interest based on the user's expressed desires, even if the object is not explicitly mentioned. For instance, if a user expresses a desire for a cold beverage, DetGPT can analyze the image, identify a fridge, and use its knowledge of typical fridge contents to locate the beverage. This flexibility makes our system applicable across a wide range of fields, from robotics and automation to autonomous driving. Overall, our proposed paradigm and DetGPT demonstrate the potential for more sophisticated and intuitive interactions between humans and machines. We hope that our proposed paradigm and approach will provide inspiration to the community and open the door to more interative and versatile object detection systems.

Scaling the diversity and quality of such data, although straightforward, stands a great chance of leading to improved performance. This paper aims to improve the upper bound of open-source models further. We first provide a systematically designed, diverse, informative, large-scale dataset of instructional conversations, UltraChat, which does not involve human queries. Our objective is to capture the breadth of interactions that a human might have with an AI assistant and employs a comprehensive framework to generate multi-turn conversation iteratively. UltraChat contains 1.5 million high-quality multi-turn dialogues and covers a wide range of topics and instructions. Our statistical analysis of UltraChat reveals its superiority in various key metrics, including scale, average length, diversity, coherence, etc., solidifying its position as a leading open-source dataset. Building upon UltraChat, we fine-tune a LLaMA model to create a powerful conversational model, UltraLLaMA. Our evaluations indicate that UltraLLaMA consistently outperforms other open-source models, including Vicuna, the previously recognized state-of-the-art open-source model.

Therefore, we investigate a new learning paradigm of text summarization models that considers the LLMs as the reference or the gold-standard oracle on commonly used summarization datasets such as the CNN/DailyMail dataset. To examine the standard practices that are aligned with the new learning setting, we propose a novel training method that is based on contrastive learning with LLMs as a summarization quality evaluator. For this reward-based training method, we investigate two different methods of utilizing LLMs for summary quality evaluation, namely GPTScore and GPTRank. Our experiments on the CNN/DailyMail dataset demonstrate that smaller summarization models trained by our proposed method can achieve performance equal to or surpass that of the reference LLMs, as evaluated by the LLMs themselves. This underscores the efficacy of our proposed paradigm in enhancing model performance over the standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training method, and its efficiency since it only requires a small budget to access the LLMs. We release the training scripts, model outputs, and LLM-based evaluation results to facilitate future studies.

Prior studies mostly contribute to adapt the retriever or stimulate the reader. Different from them, our approach pay attention of the query adaptation. Because the original query can not be always optimal to retrieve for the LLM, especially in the real world.(1) We first prompt an LLM to rewrite the queries, then conduct retrieval-augmented reading. (2) We further apply a small language model as a trainable rewriter, which rewrite the search query to cater to the frozen retriever and the LLM reader. To fine-tune the rewriter, we first use a pseudo data to conduct supervised warm-up training. Then the \textit{Retrieve-then-Read} pipeline is modeled as a reinforcement learning context. The rewriter is further trained as a policy model by maximize the reward of the pipeline performance. Evaluation is performed on two downstream tasks, open-domain QA and multiple choice.

However, existing methods for collecting instruction-tuning data suffer from limitations in scalability and affordability. In this paper, we propose Dynosaur, a dynamic growth paradigm for instruction-tuning data curation. Built upon the metadata of existing NLP datasets, we generate multiple task instructions applicable to various NLP datasets and determine the relevant data fields for constructing instruction-tuning data with LLMs. Dynosaur offers several advantages: 1) lower generation costs (less than $12 for generating 800K instruction-tuning data), 2) good quality of instruction-tuning data (better performance than Alpaca and Instruction GPT-4 on Super-NI with comparable data sizes), and 3) the ability to grow dynamically by incorporating new datasets from Huggingface Datasets Platform. We further investigate continual learning as an approach to learning with the ever-growing instruction-tuning dataset. We demonstrate that replay methods not only help mitigate forgetting issues but help generalize to unseen tasks better. As a novel continual learning scenario for instruction tuning, selecting tasks based on instruction representations can be an effective replaying strategy.

  Xu, Zongzhang Zhang, and Yang Yu",Language Model Self-improvement by Reinforcement Learning Contemplation,,,,,cs.CL cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, fine-tuning these models often necessitates substantial supervision, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised method called LanguageModel Self-Improvement by Reinforcement Learning Contemplation (SIRLC) that improves LLMs without reliance on external labels. Our approach is grounded in the observation that it is simpler for language models to assess text quality than to generate text. Building on this insight, SIRLC assigns LLMs dual roles as both student and teacher. As a student, the LLM generates answers to unlabeled questions, while as a teacher, it evaluates the generated text and assigns scores accordingly. The model parameters are updated using reinforcement learning to maximize the evaluation score. We demonstrate that SIRLC can be applied to various NLP tasks, such as reasoning problems, text generation, and machine translation. Our experiments show that SIRLC effectively improves LLM performance without external supervision, resulting in a 5.6% increase in answering accuracy for reasoning tasks and a rise in BERTScore from 0.82 to 0.86 for translation tasks. Furthermore, SIRLC can be applied to models of different sizes, showcasing its broad applicability.

However, they have overlooked the potential challenges posed by the poor quality of reasoning problems, which may influence the reasoning performance significantly. In this work, we propose Self-Polish (SP), a novel method that facilitates the model's problem-solving process by prompting them to progressively refine the given problems to be more comprehensible and solvable. Specifically, the method teaches models to eliminate irrelevant information, rearrange the logic structure and organize local conditions into new ones parallelly. SP is orthogonal to all other prompting methods, making it convenient to integrate with state-of-the-art techniques for further improvement. We conduct thorough experiments on five benchmarks to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, with Text-davinci-003, our method boosts the performance of standard few-shot prompting by $8.0\%$ on GSM8K and $17.8\%$ on MultiArith; it also improves the performance of CoT by $6.0\%$ on GSM8K and $6.0\%$ on MathQA, respectively.

While GAN-based methods have showed potential in manipulating images especially when combined with CLIP, these methods are limited in their ability to reconstruct real images due to challenging GAN inversion capability. Despite the successful image reconstruction achieved by diffusion-based methods, there are still challenges in effectively manipulating fine-gained facial attributes with textual instructions.To address these issues and facilitate convenient manipulation of real facial images, we propose a novel approach that conduct text-driven image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion model. By aligning the temporal feature of the diffusion model with the semantic condition at generative process, we introduce a stable manipulation strategy, which perform precise zero-shot manipulation effectively. Furthermore, we develop an interactive system named ChatFace, which combines the zero-shot reasoning ability of large language models to perform efficient manipulations in diffusion semantic latent space. This system enables users to perform complex multi-attribute manipulations through dialogue, opening up new possibilities for interactive image editing. Extensive experiments confirmed that our approach outperforms previous methods and enables precise editing of real facial images, making it a promising candidate for real-world applications.

Yet, their ability to generate counterfactuals, which can be used for areas like data augmentation, remains under-explored. This study aims to investigate the counterfactual generation capabilities of LLMs and analysis factors that influence this ability. First, we evaluate how effective are LLMs in counterfactual generation through data augmentation experiments for small language models (SLMs) across four tasks: sentiment analysis, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and relation extraction. While LLMs show promising enhancements in various settings, they struggle in complex tasks due to their self-limitations and the lack of logical guidance to produce counterfactuals that align with commonsense. Second, our analysis reveals the pivotal role of providing accurate task definitions and detailed step-by-step instructions to LLMs in generating counterfactuals. Interestingly, we also find that LLMs can generate reasonable counterfactuals even with unreasonable demonstrations, which illustrates that demonstrations are primarily to regulate the output format.This study provides the first comprehensive insight into counterfactual generation abilities of LLMs, and offers a novel perspective on utilizing LLMs for data augmentation to enhance SLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Wed, 24 May 2023 06:44:32 GMT'}]",2023-05-25,"[['Li', 'Yongqi', ''], ['Xu', 'Mayi', ''], ['Miao', 'Xin', ''], ['Zhou', 'Shen', ''], ['Qian', 'Tieyun', '']]",0,0,2023-05-24,1,5,1,0,0,0,f1904aadbccfc53735223375016f4b13b6149271,258866143.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f1904aadbccfc53735223375016f4b13b6149271,arXiv.org,2023.0,48.0,0.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2220318873', 'name': 'Yongqian Li'}, {'authorId': '2110520130', 'name': 'Mayi Xu'}, {'authorId': '2215546811', 'name': 'Xin Miao'}, {'authorId': '2218563624', 'name': 'Shen Zhou'}, {'authorId': '34559283', 'name': 'T.

Despite of numerous successful applications, the underlying mechanism of such in-context capabilities still remains unclear. In this work, we hypothesize that the learned \textit{semantics} of language tokens do the most heavy lifting during the reasoning process. Different from human's symbolic reasoning process, the semantic representations of LLMs could create strong connections among tokens, thus composing a superficial logical chain. To test our hypothesis, we decouple semantics from the language reasoning process and evaluate three kinds of reasoning abilities, i.e., deduction, induction and abduction. Our findings reveal that semantics play a vital role in LLMs' in-context reasoning -- LLMs perform significantly better when semantics are consistent with commonsense but struggle to solve symbolic or counter-commonsense reasoning tasks by leveraging in-context new knowledge. The surprising observations question whether modern LLMs have mastered the inductive, deductive and abductive reasoning abilities as in human intelligence, and motivate research on unveiling the magic existing within the black-box LLMs. On the whole, our analysis provides a novel perspective on the role of semantics in developing and evaluating language models' reasoning abilities.

  Song, Antoine Bosselut",CAR: Conceptualization-Augmented Reasoner for Zero-Shot Commonsense Question Answering,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The task of zero-shot commonsense question answering evaluates models on their capacity to reason about general scenarios beyond those presented in specific datasets. Existing approaches for tackling this task leverage external knowledge from CommonSense Knowledge Bases (CSKBs) by pretraining the model on synthetic QA pairs constructed from CSKBs. In these approaches, negative examples (distractors) are formulated by randomly sampling from CSKBs using fairly primitive keyword constraints. However, two bottlenecks limit these approaches: the inherent incompleteness of CSKBs limits the semantic coverage of synthetic QA pairs, and the lack of human annotations makes the sampled negative examples potentially uninformative and contradictory. To tackle these limitations above, we propose Conceptualization-Augmented Reasoner (CAR), a zero-shot commonsense question-answering framework that fully leverages the power of conceptualization. Specifically, CAR abstracts a commonsense knowledge triple to many higher-level instances, which increases the coverage of CSKB and expands the ground-truth answer space, reducing the likelihood of selecting false-negative distractors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAR more robustly generalizes to answering questions about zero-shot commonsense scenarios than existing methods, including large language models, such as GPT3.5 and ChatGPT.

Different from the conventional closed-world setting of Information Extraction (IE), Open-world IE considers a more general situation where entities and relations could be beyond a predefined ontology. More importantly, we seek to develop a large language model (LLM) that is able to perform Open-world IE to extract desirable entity profiles characterized by (possibly fine-grained) natural language instructions. We achieve this by finetuning LLMs using instruction tuning. In particular, we construct INSTRUCTOPENWIKI, a substantial instruction tuning dataset for Open-world IE enriched with a comprehensive corpus, extensive annotations, and diverse instructions. We finetune the pretrained BLOOM models on INSTRUCTOPENWIKI and obtain PIVOINE, an LLM for Open-world IE with strong instruction-following capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that PIVOINE significantly outperforms traditional closed-world methods and other LLM baselines, displaying impressive generalization capabilities on both unseen instructions and out-of-ontology cases.

It can offer rich insights into human sentiments and opinions and has thus seen considerable interest from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a great potential for their employment on SA problems. However, the extent to which existing LLMs can be leveraged for different sentiment analysis tasks remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive investigation into the capabilities of LLMs in performing various sentiment analysis tasks, from conventional sentiment classification to aspect-based sentiment analysis and multifaceted analysis of subjective texts. We evaluate performance across 13 tasks on 26 datasets and compare the results against small language models (SLMs) trained on domain-specific datasets. Our study reveals that while LLMs demonstrate satisfactory performance in simpler tasks, they lag behind in more complex tasks requiring deeper understanding or structured sentiment information. However, LLMs significantly outperform SLMs in few-shot learning settings, suggesting their potential when annotation resources are limited.

Recent works, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), have shown that intermediate reasoning steps can improve the performance of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, such as math problems and symbolic question-answering tasks. However, we notice the challenge that LLMs face when it comes to temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that generating intermediate reasoning steps does not always boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that combines the extraction capability of LLMs and the logical reasoning capability of a Python solver to tackle this issue. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in handling intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.

In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions. Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the ""Chain of Thoughts"" mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more effective features. It has achieved a remarkable 1.6 times increase in success rate on the Franka Kitchen benchmark and a 1.3 times increase on the Meta-World benchmark, compared to the BLIP-2 baseline fine-tuned with the Ego4D dataset.

  Ji",Cheap and Quick: Efficient Vision-Language Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Recently, growing interest has been aroused in extending the multimodal capability of large language models (LLMs), e.g., vision-language (VL) learning, which is regarded as the next milestone of artificial general intelligence. However, existing solutions are prohibitively expensive, which not only need to optimize excessive parameters, but also require another large-scale pre-training before VL instruction tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel and affordable solution for the effective VL adaption of LLMs, called Mixture-of-Modality Adaptation (MMA). Instead of using large neural networks to connect the image encoder and LLM, MMA adopts lightweight modules, i.e., adapters, to bridge the gap between LLMs and VL tasks, which also enables the joint optimization of the image and language models. Meanwhile, MMA is also equipped with a routing algorithm to help LLMs achieve an automatic shift between single- and multi-modal instructions without compromising their ability of natural language understanding. To validate MMA, we apply it to a recent LLM called LLaMA and term this formed large vision-language instructed model as LaVIN. To validate MMA and LaVIN, we conduct extensive experiments under two setups, namely multimodal science question answering and multimodal dialogue. The experimental results not only demonstrate the competitive performance and the superior training efficiency of LaVIN than existing multimodal LLMs, but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose chatbot. More importantly, the actual expenditure of LaVIN is extremely cheap, e.g., only 1.4 training hours with 3.8M trainable parameters, greatly confirming the effectiveness of MMA.

However, the field of pathology has largely remained untapped in this regard, despite the growing need for accurate, timely, and personalized diagnostics. To bridge the gap in pathology MLLMs, we present the PathAsst in this study, which is a generative foundation AI assistant to revolutionize diagnostic and predictive analytics in pathology. To develop PathAsst, we collect over 142K high-quality pathology image-text pairs from a variety of reliable sources, including PubMed, comprehensive pathology textbooks, reputable pathology websites, and private data annotated by pathologists. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT/GPT-4, we generate over 180K instruction-following samples. Furthermore, we devise additional instruction-following data, specifically tailored for the invocation of the pathology-specific models, allowing the PathAsst to effectively interact with these models based on the input image and user intent, consequently enhancing the model's diagnostic capabilities. Subsequently, our PathAsst is trained based on Vicuna-13B language model in coordination with the CLIP vision encoder. The results of PathAsst show the potential of harnessing the AI-powered generative foundation model to improve pathology diagnosis and treatment processes.

The core recipe of HuatuoGPT is to leverage both \textit{distilled data from ChatGPT} and \textit{real-world data from doctors} in the supervised fine-tuned stage. The responses of ChatGPT are usually detailed, well-presented and informative while it cannot perform like a doctor in many aspects, e.g. for integrative diagnosis. We argue that real-world data from doctors would be complementary to distilled data in the sense the former could tame a distilled language model to perform like doctors. To better leverage the strengths of both data, we train a reward model to align the language model with the merits that both data bring, following an RLAIF (reinforced learning from AI feedback) fashion. To evaluate and benchmark the models, we propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme (including automatic and manual metrics). Experimental results demonstrate that HuatuoGPT achieves state-of-the-art results in performing medical consultation among open-source LLMs in GPT-4 evaluation, human evaluation, and medical benchmark datasets. It is worth noting that by using additional real-world data and RLAIF, the distilled language model (i.e., HuatuoGPT) outperforms its teacher model ChatGPT in most cases.

However, even in the case of unlabeled data, their acquisition presents challenges in certain domains due to various reasons. To address these issues, we present SynCSE, a contrastive learning framework that trains sentence embeddings with synthesized data. Specifically, we explore utilizing large language models to synthesize the required data samples for contrastive learning, including (1) producing positive and negative annotations given unlabeled sentences (SynCSE-partial), and (2) generating sentences along with their corresponding annotations from scratch (SynCSE-scratch). Experimental results on sentence similarity and reranking tasks indicate that both SynCSE-partial and SynCSE-scratch greatly outperform unsupervised baselines, and SynCSE-partial even achieves comparable performance to the supervised models in most settings.

It is interesting how the LLMs obtain their ability to carry out translation instructions for different languages. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis by finetuning a multilingual pretrained language model, XGLM-7B, to perform multilingual translation following given instructions. Firstly, we show that multilingual LLMs have stronger translation abilities than previously demonstrated. For a certain language, the performance depends on its similarity to English and the amount of data used in the pretraining phase. Secondly, we find that LLMs' ability to carry out translation instructions relies on the understanding of translation instructions and the alignment among different languages. With multilingual finetuning, LLMs could learn to perform the translation task well even for those language pairs unseen during the instruction tuning phase.

In this work, we propose search-augmented instruction learning (SAIL), which grounds the language generation and instruction following abilities on complex search results generated by in-house and external search engines. With an instruction tuning corpus, we collect search results for each training case from different search APIs and domains, and construct a new search-grounded training set containing \textit{(instruction, grounding information, response)} triplets. We then fine-tune the LLaMA-7B model on the constructed training set. Since the collected results contain unrelated and disputing languages, the model needs to learn to ground on trustworthy search results, filter out distracting passages, and generate the target response. The search result-denoising process entails explicit trustworthy information selection and multi-hop reasoning, since the retrieved passages might be informative but not contain the instruction-following answer. Experiments show that the fine-tuned SAIL-7B model has a strong instruction-following ability, and it performs significantly better on transparency-sensitive tasks, including open-ended question answering and fact checking.

Recent studies have begun leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address event semantic processing. However, the extent that LLMs can effectively tackle these challenges remains uncertain. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework for event semantic processing poses a significant challenge in evaluating these capabilities. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework for event semantic processing, encompassing understanding, reasoning, and prediction, along with their fine-grained aspects. To comprehensively evaluate the event semantic processing abilities of models, we introduce a novel benchmark called EVEVAL. We collect 8 datasets that cover all aspects of event semantic processing.

Retrieval-augmented large language models have raised extensive attention for grounding model generation on external knowledge. However, retrievers struggle to capture relevance, especially for queries with complex information needs. Recent work has proposed to improve relevance modeling by having large language models actively involved in retrieval, i.e., to improve retrieval with generation. In this paper, we show that strong performance can be achieved by a method we call Iter-RetGen, which synergizes retrieval and generation in an iterative manner. A model output shows what might be needed to finish a task, and thus provides an informative context for retrieving more relevant knowledge which in turn helps generate a better output in the next iteration. Compared with recent work which interleaves retrieval with generation when producing an output, Iter-RetGen processes all retrieved knowledge as a whole and largely preserves the flexibility in generation without structural constraints. We evaluate Iter-RetGen on multi-hop question answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning, and show that it can flexibly leverage parametric knowledge and non-parametric knowledge, and is superior to or competitive with state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented baselines while causing fewer overheads of retrieval and generation. We can further improve performance via generation-augmented retrieval adaptation.

It is challenging to determine a good search query from the whole conversation context. To avoid the expensive re-training of the query encoder, most existing methods try to learn a rewriting model to de-contextualize the current query by mimicking the manual query rewriting. However, manually rewritten queries are not always the best search queries. Training a rewriting model on them would limit the model's ability to produce good search queries. Another useful hint is the potential answer to the question. In this paper, we propose ConvGQR, a new framework to reformulate conversational queries based on generative pre-trained language models (PLMs), one for query rewriting and another for generating potential answers. By combining both, ConvGQR can produce better search queries. In addition, to relate query reformulation to retrieval performance, we propose a knowledge infusion mechanism to optimize both query reformulation and retrieval.

However, when deployed to unfamiliar environments, we show that LLM agents face challenges in efficiently gathering necessary information, leading to suboptimal performance. On the other hand, in unfamiliar scenarios, human individuals often seek additional information from their peers before taking action, leveraging external knowledge to avoid unnecessary trial and error. Building upon this intuition, we propose \textit{Asking Before Action} (ABA), a method that empowers the agent to proactively query external sources for pertinent information using natural language during their interactions in the environment. In this way, the agent is able to enhance its efficiency and performance by mitigating wasteful steps and circumventing the difficulties associated with exploration in unfamiliar environments. We empirically evaluate our method on an embodied decision making benchmark, ALFWorld, and demonstrate that despite modest modifications in prompts, our method exceeds baseline LLM agents by more than $40$%. Further experiments on two variants of ALFWorld illustrate that by imitation learning, ABA effectively retains and reuses queried and known information in subsequent tasks, mitigating the need for repetitive inquiries. Both qualitative and quantitative results exhibit remarkable performance on tasks that previous methods struggle to solve.

Work in Progres,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Generating and editing a 3D scene guided by natural language poses a challenge, primarily due to the complexity of specifying the positional relations and volumetric changes within the 3D space. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning, conversational, and zero-shot generation abilities across various domains. Surprisingly, these models also show great potential in realizing and interpreting the 3D space. In light of this, we propose a novel language-guided interactive 3D generation system, dubbed LI3D, that integrates LLMs as a 3D layout interpreter into the off-the-shelf layout-to-3D generative models, allowing users to flexibly and interactively generate visual content. Specifically, we design a versatile layout structure base on the bounding boxes and semantics to prompt the LLMs to model the spatial generation and reasoning from language. Our system also incorporates LLaVA, a large language and vision assistant, to provide generative feedback from the visual aspect for improving the visual quality of generated content. We validate the effectiveness of LI3D, primarily in 3D generation and editing through multi-round interactions, which can be flexibly extended to 2D generation and editing. Various experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating LLMs in generative AI for applications, e.g., metaverse. Moreover, we benchmark the layout reasoning performance of LLMs with neural visual artist tasks, revealing their emergent ability in the spatial layout domain.

However, the existing knowledge bases heavily rely on manual annotation which unavoidably causes deficiency in coverage of world-wide commonsense knowledge. Accordingly, the knowledge bases fail to be flexible enough to support the reasoning over diverse questions. Recently, large-scale language models (LLMs) have dramatically improved the intelligence in capturing and leveraging knowledge, which opens up a new way to address the issue of eliciting knowledge from language models. We propose a Unified Facts Obtaining (UFO) approach. UFO turns LLMs into knowledge sources and produces relevant facts (knowledge statements) for the given question. We first develop a unified prompt consisting of demonstrations that cover different aspects of commonsense and different question styles. On this basis, we instruct the LLMs to generate question-related supporting facts for various commonsense questions via prompting. After facts generation, we apply a dense retrieval-based fact selection strategy to choose the best-matched fact. This kind of facts will be fed into the answer inference model along with the question. Notably, due to the design of unified prompts, UFO can support reasoning in various commonsense aspects (including general commonsense, scientific commonsense, and social commonsense). Extensive experiments on CommonsenseQA 2.0, OpenBookQA, QASC, and Social IQA benchmarks show that UFO significantly improves the performance of the inference model and outperforms manually constructed knowledge sources.

However, there still exists a significant discrepancy between their capability in solving complex reasoning problems and that of humans. At present, most approaches focus on chains of thought (COT) and tool use, without considering the adoption and application of human cognitive frameworks. It is well-known that when confronting complex reasoning challenges, humans typically employ various cognitive abilities, and necessitate interaction with all aspects of tools, knowledge, and the external environment information to accomplish intricate tasks. This paper introduces a novel intelligent framework, referred to as OlaGPT. OlaGPT carefully studied a cognitive architecture framework, and propose to simulate certain aspects of human cognition. The framework involves approximating different cognitive modules, including attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and corresponding scheduling and decision-making mechanisms. Inspired by the active learning mechanism of human beings, it proposes a learning unit to record previous mistakes and expert opinions, and dynamically refer to them to strengthen their ability to solve similar problems. The paper also outlines common effective reasoning frameworks for human problem-solving and designs Chain-of-Thought (COT) templates accordingly. A comprehensive decision-making mechanism is also proposed to maximize model accuracy. The efficacy of OlaGPT has been stringently evaluated on multiple reasoning datasets, and the experimental outcomes reveal that OlaGPT surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

Our pilot experiments show that PandaGPT can perform complex tasks such as detailed image description generation, writing stories inspired by videos, and answering questions about audios. More interestingly, PandaGPT can take multimodal inputs simultaneously and compose their semantics naturally. For example, PandaGPT can connect how objects look in an image/video and how they sound in an audio. To do so, PandaGPT combines the multimodal encoders from ImageBind and the large language models from Vicuna. Notably, only aligned image-text pairs are required for the training of PandaGPT. Thanks to the strong capability of ImageBind in embedding data from different modalities into the same space, PandaGPT displays emergent, i.e. zero-shot, cross-modal behaviors for data other than image and text (e.g., video, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU).

2305.16582,Yao Yao,"Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao","Beyond Chain-of-Thought, Effective Graph-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models",,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, researchers have discovered the potential of Chain-of-thought (CoT) to assist LLMs in accomplishing complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate steps. However, human thought processes are often non-linear, rather than simply sequential chains of thoughts. Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as a graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as edges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and allows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. Similar to Multimodal-CoT, we modeled GoT reasoning as a two-stage framework, generating rationales first and then producing the final answer. Specifically, we employ an additional graph-of-thoughts encoder for GoT representation learning and fuse the GoT representation with the original input representation through a gated fusion mechanism. We implement a GoT reasoning model on the T5 pre-trained model and evaluate its performance on a text-only reasoning task (GSM8K) and a multimodal reasoning task (ScienceQA). Our model achieves significant improvement over the strong CoT baseline with 3.41% and 5.08% on the GSM8K test set with T5-base and T5-large architectures, respectively. Additionally, our model boosts accuracy from 84.91% to 91.54% using the T5-base model and from 91.68% to 92.77% using the T5-large model over the state-of-the-art Multimodal-CoT on the ScienceQA test set. Experiments have shown that GoT achieves comparable results to Multimodal-CoT(large) with over 700M parameters, despite having fewer than 250M backbone model parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of GoT.

Some methods train dedicated detectors on specific datasets but fall short in generalizing to unseen test data, while other zero-shot ones often yield suboptimal performance. Although the recent DetectGPT has shown promising detection performance, it suffers from significant inefficiency issues, as detecting a single candidate requires scoring hundreds of its perturbations with the source LLM. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Technically, we propose to incorporate a Bayesian surrogate model, which allows us to select typical samples based on Bayesian uncertainty and interpolate scores from typical samples to other ones, to improve query efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under a low query budget. Notably, our method achieves similar performance with up to 2 times fewer queries than DetectGPT and 3.7% higher AUROC at a query number of 5.

  Cheung, Min Lin",On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models,,,,,cs.CV cs.CL cs.CR cs.LG cs.MM,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved unprecedented performance in response generation, especially with visual inputs, enabling more creative and adaptable interaction than large language models such as ChatGPT. Nonetheless, multimodal generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable modality (e.g., vision). To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses. In particular, we first craft targeted adversarial examples against pretrained models such as CLIP and BLIP, and then transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, UniDiffuser, BLIP-2, and Img2Prompt. In addition, we observe that black-box queries on these VLMs can further improve the effectiveness of targeted evasion, resulting in a surprisingly high success rate for generating targeted responses. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding regarding the adversarial vulnerability of large VLMs and call for a more thorough examination of their potential security flaws before deployment in practice.

In this work, we aim to utilize visual information for composition in the same manner as humans. We propose a method, LIVE, that makes pre-trained language models (PLMs) Learn to Imagine for Visuallyaugmented natural language gEneration. First, we imagine the scene based on the text: we use a diffusion model to synthesize high-quality images conditioned on the input texts. Second, we use CLIP to determine whether the text can evoke the imagination in a posterior way. Finally, our imagination is dynamic, and we conduct synthesis for each sentence rather than generate only one image for an entire paragraph. Technically, we propose a novel plug-and-play fusion layer to obtain visually-augmented representations for each text. Our vision-text fusion layer is compatible with Transformerbased architecture.

Recent implementations of NN-based societies of minds consist of large language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through a natural language interface. In doing so, they overcome the limitations of single LLMs, improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning. In these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), new agents -- all communicating through the same universal symbolic language -- are easily added in a modular fashion. To demonstrate the power of NLSOMs, we assemble and experiment with several of them (having up to 129 members), leveraging mindstorms in them to solve some practical AI tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language-based task solving. We view this as a starting point towards much larger NLSOMs with billions of agents-some of which may be humans. And with this emergence of great societies of heterogeneous minds, many new research questions have suddenly become paramount to the future of artificial intelligence. What should be the social structure of an NLSOM? What would be the (dis)advantages of having a monarchical rather than a democratic structure? How can principles of NN economies be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement learning NLSOM? In this work, we identify, discuss, and try to answer some of these questions.

However, the current research landscape predominantly focuses on specific objectives, such as the popular ""ObtainDiamond"" task, and has not yet shown effective generalization to a broader spectrum of tasks. Furthermore, the current leading success rate for the ""ObtainDiamond"" task stands at around 20%, highlighting the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) based controllers used in existing methods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Ghost in the Minecraft (GITM), a novel framework integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-based knowledge and memory, aiming to create Generally Capable Agents (GCAs) in Minecraft. These agents, equipped with the logic and common sense capabilities of LLMs, can skillfully navigate complex, sparse-reward environments with text-based interactions. We develop a set of structured actions and leverage LLMs to generate action plans for the agents to execute. The resulting LLM-based agent markedly surpasses previous methods, achieving a remarkable improvement of +47.5% in success rate on the ""ObtainDiamond"" task, demonstrating superior robustness compared to traditional RL-based controllers. Notably, our agent is the first to procure all items in the Minecraft Overworld technology tree, demonstrating its extensive capabilities. GITM does not need any GPU for training, but a single CPU node with 32 CPU cores is enough. This research shows the potential of LLMs in developing capable agents for handling long-horizon, complex tasks and adapting to uncertainties in open-world environments.

In this paper, we propose A2EHV, an Automated Alignment Evaluation with a Heterogeneous Value system that (1) is automated to minimize individual human biases, and (2) allows assessments against various target values to foster heterogeneous agents. Our approach pivots on the concept of value rationality, which represents the ability for agents to execute behaviors that satisfy a target value the most. The quantification of value rationality is facilitated by the Social Value Orientation framework from social psychology, which partitions the value space into four categories to assess social preferences from agents' behaviors. We evaluate the value rationality of eight mainstream LLMs and observe that large models are more inclined to align neutral values compared to those with strong personal values. By examining the behavior of these LLMs, we contribute to a deeper understanding of value alignment within a heterogeneous value system.

In this work, we design a prompting strategy that formulates a number of different NLU tasks as contextual entailment. This approach improves the zero-shot adaptation of pretrained entailment models. Secondly, we notice that self-training entailment-based models with unlabeled data can significantly improve the adaptation performance on downstream tasks. To achieve more stable improvement, we propose the Simple Pseudo-Label Editing (SimPLE) algorithm for better pseudo-labeling quality in self-training. We also found that both pretrained entailment-based models and the self-trained models are robust against adversarial evaluation data. Experiments on binary and multi-class classification tasks show that SimPLE leads to more robust self-training results, indicating that the self-trained entailment models are more efficient and trustworthy than large language models on language understanding tasks.

Prior works on retrieval augmentation usually jointly fine-tune the retriever and the LM, making them closely coupled. In this paper, we explore the scheme of generic retrieval plug-in: the retriever is to assist target LMs that may not be known beforehand or are unable to be fine-tuned together. To retrieve useful documents for unseen target LMs, we propose augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which learns LM's preferences obtained from a known source LM. Experiments on the MMLU and PopQA datasets demonstrate that our AAR trained with a small source LM is able to significantly improve the zero-shot generalization of larger target LMs ranging from 250M Flan-T5 to 175B InstructGPT. Further analysis indicates that the preferences of different LMs overlap, enabling AAR trained with a single source LM to serve as a generic plug-in for various target LMs. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenMatch/Augmentation-Adapted-Retriever.

However, their computational costs are also dramatically growing with rapid development, especially for the large models. It makes model acceleration exceedingly critical in a scenario of limited resources. Although extensively studied for unimodal models, the acceleration for multimodal models, especially the vision-language Transformers, is relatively under-explored. To pursue more efficient and accessible vision-language Transformers, this paper introduces \textbf{Cross}-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{T}okens (\textbf{\emph{CrossGET}}), a universal acceleration framework for vision-language Transformers. This framework adaptively combines tokens through real-time, cross-modal guidance, thereby achieving substantial acceleration while keeping high performance. \textit{CrossGET} has two key innovations: 1) \textit{Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble}. \textit{CrossGET} incorporates cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble to exploit cross-modal information effectively, only introducing cross-modal tokens with negligible extra parameters. 2) \textit{Complete-Graph Soft Matching}. In contrast to the existing bipartite soft matching approach, \textit{CrossGET} introduces a complete-graph soft matching policy to achieve more reliable token-matching results while maintaining parallelizability and high efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted on various vision-language tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, image captioning, and visual question answering. Performance on both classic multimodal architectures and emerging multimodal LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed \textit{CrossGET} framework.

Conversation reasoning, as a critical component of it, remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a well-designed cognitive model. In this paper, inspired by intuition theory on conversation cognition, we develop a conversation cognitive model (CCM) that explains how each utterance receives and activates channels of information recursively. Besides, we algebraically transformed CCM into a structural causal model (SCM) under some mild assumptions, rendering it compatible with various causal discovery methods. We further propose a probabilistic implementation of the SCM for utterance-level relation reasoning. By leveraging variational inference, it explores substitutes for implicit causes, addresses the issue of their unobservability, and reconstructs the causal representations of utterances through the evidence lower bounds. Moreover, we constructed synthetic and simulated datasets incorporating implicit causes and complete cause labels, alleviating the current situation where all available datasets are implicit-causes-agnostic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets. Finally, we analyze the performance of CCM under latent confounders and propose theoretical ideas for addressing this currently unresolved issue.

A solution is proposed based on prompt learning and the utilization of a large language model, GPT-4. Since a WSI is too large and needs to be divided into patches for processing, WSI classification is commonly approached as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. In this context, each WSI is considered a bag, and the obtained patches are treated as instances. The objective of FSWC is to classify both bags and instances with only a limited number of labeled bags. Unlike conventional few-shot learning problems, FSWC poses additional challenges due to its weak bag labels within the MIL framework. Drawing inspiration from the recent achievements of vision-language models (V-L models) in downstream few-shot classification tasks, we propose a two-level prompt learning MIL framework tailored for pathology, incorporating language prior knowledge. Specifically, we leverage CLIP to extract instance features for each patch, and introduce a prompt-guided pooling strategy to aggregate these instance features into a bag feature. Subsequently, we employ a small number of labeled bags to facilitate few-shot prompt learning based on the bag features. Our approach incorporates the utilization of GPT-4 in a question-and-answer mode to obtain language prior knowledge at both the instance and bag levels, which are then integrated into the instance and bag level language prompts. Additionally, a learnable component of the language prompts is trained using the available few-shot labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three real WSI datasets encompassing breast cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer, demonstrating the notable performance of the proposed method in bag and instance classification. All codes will be made publicly accessible.

We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., Vicuna-13B could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries with ChatGPT as an evaluator. To address this issue, we propose a calibration framework with three simple yet effective strategies: 1) Multiple Evidence Calibration, which requires the evaluator model to generate multiple evaluation evidence before assigning ratings; 2) Balanced Position Calibration, which aggregates results across various orders to determine the final score; 3) Human-in-the-Loop Calibration, which introduces a balanced position diversity entropy to measure the difficulty of each example and seeks human assistance when needed. We also manually annotate the ""win/tie/lose"" outcomes of responses from ChatGPT and Vicuna-13B in the Vicuna Benchmark's question prompt, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments.

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images that are semantically coherent with given texts. This presents an opportunity to generate synthetic training images for TIC. However, we have identified a challenge that the images generated from simple descriptions typically exhibit a single perspective with one or limited contexts, which is not aligned with the complexity of real-world scenes in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses this issue by introducing multi-context data generation. Starting with an initial text corpus, our framework employs a large language model to select multiple sentences that describe the same scene from various perspectives. These sentences are then summarized into a single sentence with multiple contexts. We generate simple images using the straightforward sentences and complex images using the summarized sentences through diffusion models. Finally, we train the model exclusively using the synthetic image-text pairs obtained from this process.

Each time cloud computing applications and services hosted on the cloud are affected by a cloud outage, users can experience slow response times, connection issues or total service disruption, resulting in a significant negative business impact. Outages are usually comprised of several concurring events/source causes, and therefore understanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first step toward mitigating and resolving outages. In current practice, on-call engineers with in-depth domain knowledge, have to manually assess and summarize outages when they happen, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we first present a large-scale empirical study investigating the way on-call engineers currently deal with cloud outages at Microsoft, and then present and empirically validate a novel approach (dubbed Oasis) to help the engineers in this task. Oasis is able to automatically assess the impact scope of outages as well as to produce human-readable summarization. Specifically, Oasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant incidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary by leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact assessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago, and it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been recently introduced, and in this article we present the results of an empirical evaluation we carried out on 18 real-world cloud systems as well as a human-based evaluation with outage owners. The results show that Oasis can effectively and efficiently summarize outages, and lead Microsoft to deploy its first prototype which is currently under experimental adoption by some of the incident teams.

However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTranslate is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTranslate model.

  Ruifeng Li, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang",Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recent releases of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, are astonishing at generating human-like texts, but they may impact the authenticity of texts. Previous works proposed methods to detect these AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based zero-shot methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors always fail on short texts, like SMSes, Tweets, and reviews. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the difficulty of short-text detection without sacrificing long-texts. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase AI text detection as a partial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by regarding these short machine texts as partially ""unlabeled"". Then in this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where a recurrent model in abstraction is used to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpora. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpora. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated texts, and significantly improves short-text detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors on various short-text and long-text detection benchmarks.

Current research focuses on enhancing their performance within their existing knowledge. Despite their vast knowledge, LLMs are still limited by the amount of information they can accommodate and comprehend. Therefore, the ability to understand their own limitations on the unknows, referred to as self-knowledge, is of paramount importance. This study aims to evaluate LLMs' self-knowledge by assessing their ability to identify unanswerable or unknowable questions. We introduce an automated methodology to detect uncertainty in the responses of these models, providing a novel measure of their self-knowledge. We further introduce a unique dataset, SelfAware, consisting of unanswerable questions from five diverse categories and their answerable counterparts. Our extensive analysis, involving 20 LLMs including GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA, discovering an intrinsic capacity for self-knowledge within these models. Moreover, we demonstrate that in-context learning and instruction tuning can further enhance this self-knowledge. Despite this promising insight, our findings also highlight a considerable gap between the capabilities of these models and human proficiency in recognizing the limits of their knowledge.

In the conversational environment, multiple contextualized explanations need to be generated, which poses further challenges for explanations. To better measure explainability in conversational recommender systems (CRS), we propose ten evaluation perspectives based on concepts from conventional recommender systems together with the characteristics of CRS. We assess five existing CRS benchmark datasets using these metrics and observe the necessity of improving the explanation quality of CRS. To achieve this, we conduct manual and automatic approaches to extend these dialogues and construct a new CRS dataset, namely Explainable Recommendation Dialogues (E-ReDial). It includes 756 dialogues with over 2,000 high-quality rewritten explanations. We compare two baseline approaches to perform explanation generation based on E-ReDial. Experimental results suggest that models trained on E-ReDial can significantly improve explainability while introducing knowledge into the models can further improve the performance. GPT-3 in the in-context learning setting can generate more realistic and diverse movie descriptions. In contrast, T5 training on E-ReDial can better generate clear reasons for recommendations based on user preferences. E-ReDial is available at https://github.com/Superbooming/E-ReDial.

Compared to the state-of-the-art Iron (NeurIPS 2022), our privacy-computing friendly model inference pipeline achieves a $5\times$ acceleration in computation and an 80\% reduction in communication overhead, while retaining nearly identical accuracy.

Although low-rank adaption (LoRA) has emerged to cheaply fine-tune these LPMs on downstream tasks, their deployment is still hindered by the vast model scale and computational costs. Neural network pruning offers a way to compress LPMs. However, the current pruning methods designed for LPMs are not compatible with LoRA. This is due to their utilization of unstructured pruning on LPMs, impeding the merging of LoRA weights, or their dependence on the gradients of pre-trained weights to guide pruning, which can impose significant memory overhead. To this end, we propose LoRAPrune, a new framework that delivers an accurate, compact model for efficient inference in a highly memory-effective manner. Specifically, we first design a LoRA-guided pruning criterion, which uses the weights and gradients of LoRA, rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights for importance estimation. We then propose a structured iterative pruning procedure, to remove redundant channels and heads. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our LoRAPrune over existing approaches on the LLaMA series models. For instance, at a 50\% compression rate, LoRAPrune outperforms LLM-Pruner by a perplexity reduction of 8.0 on WikiText2 and 16.05 on PTB datasets, while concurrently reducing memory usage by 52.6\%.

Additionally, 2D spatial structures widely used in T2A works lead to unsatisfactory audio quality when generating variable-length audio samples since they do not adequately prioritize temporal information. To address these challenges, we propose Make-an-Audio 2, a latent diffusion-based T2A method that builds on the success of Make-an-Audio. Our approach includes several techniques to improve semantic alignment and temporal consistency: Firstly, we use pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to parse the text into structured <event & order> pairs for better temporal information capture. We also introduce another structured-text encoder to aid in learning semantic alignment during the diffusion denoising process. To improve the performance of variable length generation and enhance the temporal information extraction, we design a feed-forward Transformer-based diffusion denoiser. Finally, we use LLMs to augment and transform a large amount of audio-label data into audio-text datasets to alleviate the problem of scarcity of temporal data. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baseline models in both objective and subjective metrics, and achieves significant gains in temporal information understanding, semantic consistency, and sound quality.

However, current prompting methods generate natural language intermediate steps to help reasoning, which can cause imperfect task reduction and confusion. To mitigate such limitations, we explore code prompting, a neural symbolic prompting method with both zero-shot and few-shot versions which triggers code as intermediate steps. We conduct experiments on 7 widely-used benchmarks involving symbolic reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Code prompting generally outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. To further understand the performance and limitations of code prompting, we perform extensive ablation studies and error analyses, and identify several exclusive advantages of using symbolic promptings compared to natural language.

However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges. Last, we offer our insights into the current research status and future trends in this area.

Advanced proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential for tool usage through sophisticated prompt engineering. Nevertheless, these models typically rely on prohibitive computational costs and publicly inaccessible data. To address these challenges, we propose the GPT4Tools based on self-instruct to enable open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and OPT, to use tools. It generates an instruction-following dataset by prompting an advanced teacher with various multi-modal contexts. By using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimization, our approach facilitates the open-source LLMs to solve a range of visual problems, including visual comprehension and image generation. Moreover, we provide a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to use tools, which is performed in both zero-shot and fine-tuning ways. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various language models, which not only significantly improves the accuracy of invoking seen tools, but also enables the zero-shot capacity for unseen tools.

These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further propose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively generates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective learning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and finetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial perception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the superiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a significant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4 based robot tasks.

Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of ""tit for tat"" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation. Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate and the modest level of ""tit for tat"" state are required for MAD to obtain good performance. Moreover, we find that LLMs might not be a fair judge if different LLMs are used for agents.

Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.

Nonetheless, the challenges of electrocatalytic reactions and developing a large-scale language model in catalysis persist, and the recent success of ChatGPT's (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) few-shot methods surpassing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) underscores the importance of addressing limited data, expensive computations, time constraints and structure-activity relationship in research. Hence, the development of few-shot techniques for catalysis is critical and essential, regardless of present and future requirements. This paper introduces the Few-Shot Open Catalyst Challenge 2023, a competition aimed at advancing the application of machine learning technology for predicting catalytic reactions on catalytic surfaces, with a specific focus on dual-atom catalysts in hydrogen peroxide electrocatalysis. To address the challenge of limited data in catalysis, we propose a machine learning approach based on MLP-Like and a framework called Catalysis Distillation Graph Neural Network (CDGNN). Our results demonstrate that CDGNN effectively learns embeddings from catalytic structures, enabling the capture of structure-adsorption relationships. This accomplishment has resulted in the utmost advanced and efficient determination of the reaction pathway for hydrogen peroxide, surpassing the current graph neural network approach by 16.1%.. Consequently, CDGNN presents a promising approach for few-shot learning in catalysis.

However, previous methods fail to perform accurate modality alignment between text concepts and generated images due to the lack of fine-level semantic guidance that successfully diagnoses the modality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose FineRewards to improve the alignment between text and images in text-to-image diffusion models by introducing two new fine-grained semantic rewards: the caption reward and the Semantic Segment Anything (SAM) reward. From the global semantic view, the caption reward generates a corresponding detailed caption that depicts all important contents in the synthetic image via a BLIP-2 model and then calculates the reward score by measuring the similarity between the generated caption and the given prompt. From the local semantic view, the SAM reward segments the generated images into local parts with category labels, and scores the segmented parts by measuring the likelihood of each category appearing in the prompted scene via a large language model, i.e., Vicuna-7B. Additionally, we adopt an assemble reward-ranked learning strategy to enable the integration of multiple reward functions to jointly guide the model training. Adapting results of text-to-image models on the MS-COCO benchmark show that the proposed semantic reward outperforms other baseline reward functions with a considerable margin on both visual quality and semantic similarity with the input prompt. Moreover, by adopting the assemble reward-ranked learning strategy, we further demonstrate that model performance is further improved when adapting under the unifying of the proposed semantic reward with the current image rewards.

Therefore, effectively compressing large-scale PLMs becomes an increasingly important problem. Quantization, which represents high-precision tensors with low-bit fix-point format, is a viable solution. However, most existing quantization methods are task-specific, requiring customized training and quantization with a large number of trainable parameters on each individual task. Inspired by the observation that the over-parameterization nature of PLMs makes it possible to freeze most of the parameters during the fine-tuning stage, in this work, we propose a novel ``quantize before fine-tuning'' framework, PreQuant, that differs from both quantization-aware training and post-training quantization. PreQuant is compatible with various quantization strategies, with outlier-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning incorporated to correct the induced quantization error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PreQuant on the GLUE benchmark using BERT, RoBERTa, and T5. We also provide an empirical investigation into the workflow of PreQuant, which sheds light on its efficacy.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to accelerate clinical curation via few-shot in-context learning, in contrast to supervised learning which requires much more costly human annotations. However, despite drastic advances in modern LLMs such as GPT-4, they still struggle with issues regarding accuracy and interpretability, especially in mission-critical domains such as health. Here, we explore a general mitigation framework using self-verification, which leverages the LLM to provide provenance for its own extraction and check its own outputs. This is made possible by the asymmetry between verification and generation, where the latter is often much easier than the former. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves accuracy for various LLMs in standard clinical information extraction tasks. Additionally, self-verification yields interpretations in the form of a short text span corresponding to each output, which makes it very efficient for human experts to audit the results, paving the way towards trustworthy extraction of clinical information in resource-constrained scenarios.

In terms of vision-language (VL) tasks, they often serve as a language encoder and still require an additional fusion network for VL reasoning, resulting in excessive memory overhead. In this paper, we focus on exploring PLMs as a stand-alone model for VL reasoning tasks. Inspired by the recently popular prompt tuning, we first prove that the processed visual features can be also projected onto the semantic space of PLMs and act as prompt tokens to bridge the gap between single- and multi-modal learning. However, this solution exhibits obvious redundancy in visual information and model inference, and the placement of prompt tokens also greatly affects the final performance. Based on these observations, we further propose a novel transfer learning approach for PLMs, termed Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP). Concretely, DVP first deploys a cross-attention module to obtain text-related and compact visual prompt tokens, thereby greatly reducing the input length of PLMs. To obtain the optimal placement, we also equip DVP with a reinforcement-learning based search algorithm, which can automatically merge DVP with PLMs for different VL tasks via a very short search process. In addition, we also experiment DVP with the recently popular adapter approach to keep the most parameters of PLMs intact when adapting to VL tasks, helping PLMs achieve a quick shift between single- and multi-modal tasks. We apply DVP to two representative PLMs, namely BERT and T5, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of VL reasoning benchmarks including VQA2.0, GQA and SNLIVE. The experimental results not only show the advantage of DVP on efficiency and performance, but also confirm its superiority in adapting pre-trained language models to VL tasks.

They introduce extra learnable modules into existing language models to capture layout information within document images from text bounding box coordinates obtained by OCR tools. However, extra modules necessitate pre-training on extensive document images. This prevents these methods from directly utilizing off-the-shelf instruction-tuning language foundation models, which have recently shown promising potential in zero-shot learning. Instead, in this paper, we find that instruction-tuning language models like Claude and ChatGPT can understand layout by spaces and line breaks. Based on this observation, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Prompt (LATIN-Prompt), which consists of layout-aware document content and task-aware instruction. Specifically, the former uses appropriate spaces and line breaks to recover the layout information among text segments obtained by OCR tools, and the latter ensures that generated answers adhere to formatting requirements. Moreover, we propose the LAyout and Task aware Instruction Tuning (LATIN-Tuning) to improve the performance of small instruction-tuning models like Alpaca. Experimental results show that LATIN-Prompt enables zero-shot performance of Claude and ChatGPT to be comparable to the fine-tuning performance of SOTAs on document image question answering, and LATIN-Tuning enhances the zero-shot performance of Alpaca significantly. For example, LATIN-Prompt improves the performance of Claude and ChatGPT on DocVQA by 263% and 20% respectively. LATIN-Tuning improves the performance of Alpaca on DocVQA by 87.7%.

This task is challenging due to the significant discrepancy between unstructured user queries and structured explanation graphs.

Such powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced generative ability and multimodal understanding capability, which quickly achieve new state-of-the-art performances on a variety of benchmarks. The pre-trained LLM usually plays the role as a universal AI model that can conduct various tasks, including context reasoning, article analysis and image content comprehension. However, considering the prohibitively high memory and computational cost for implementing such a large model, the conventional models (such as CNN and ViT), are still essential for many visual perception tasks. In this paper, we propose to enhance the representation ability of ordinary vision models for perception tasks (e.g. image classification) by taking advantage of large pre-trained models. We present a new learning paradigm in which the knowledge extracted from large pre-trained models are utilized to help models like CNN and ViT learn enhanced representations and achieve better performance. Firstly, we curate a high quality description set by prompting a multimodal LLM to generate descriptive text for all training images. Furthermore, we feed these detailed descriptions into a pre-trained encoder to extract text embeddings with rich semantic information that encodes the content of images. During training, text embeddings will serve as extra supervising signals and be aligned with image representations learned by vision models. The alignment process helps vision models learn better and achieve higher accuracy with the assistance of pre-trained LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that the proposed algorithm consistently improves the performance for various vision models with heterogeneous architectures.

We then propose to search for the optimal per-channel scaling that protects the salient weights by observing the activation, not weights. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it can well preserve LLMs' generalization ability on different domains and modalities, without overfitting to the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks. Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for LLMs on the edge, offering more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPU (NVIDIA Jetson Orin 64GB).

2306.01242,Zhizheng Zhang,"Zhizheng Zhang, Xiaoyi Zhang, Wenxuan Xie, Yan Lu",Responsible Task Automation: Empowering Large Language Models as Responsible Task Automators,,,,,cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) signifies an impressive stride towards artificial general intelligence. They have shown a promising prospect in automatically completing tasks upon user instructions, functioning as brain-like coordinators. The associated risks will be revealed as we delegate an increasing number of tasks to machines for automated completion. A big question emerges: how can we make machines behave responsibly when helping humans automate tasks as personal copilots? In this paper, we explore this question in depth from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness and security. In specific, we present Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA) as a fundamental framework to facilitate responsible collaboration between LLM-based coordinators and executors for task automation with three empowered capabilities: 1) predicting the feasibility of the commands for executors; 2) verifying the completeness of executors; 3) enhancing the security (e.g., the protection of users' privacy). We further propose and compare two paradigms for implementing the first two capabilities. One is to leverage the generic knowledge of LLMs themselves via prompt engineering while the other is to adopt domain-specific learnable models. Moreover, we introduce a local memory mechanism for achieving the third capability. We evaluate our proposed ResponsibleTA on UI task automation and hope it could bring more attentions to ensuring LLMs more responsible in diverse scenarios.

This paper presents a novel evaluation of the programming proficiency of Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, against coding problems of varying difficulty levels drawn from Codewars. The experiments reveal a distinct boundary at the 3kyu level, beyond which these GPT models struggle to provide solutions. These findings led to the proposal of a measure for coding problem complexity that incorporates both problem difficulty and the time required for solution. The research emphasizes the need for validation and creative thinking capabilities in AI models to better emulate human problem-solving techniques. Future work aims to refine this proposed complexity measure, enhance AI models with these suggested capabilities, and develop an objective measure for programming problem difficulty. The results of this research offer invaluable insights for improving AI programming capabilities and advancing the frontier of AI problem-solving abilities.

By way of mitigating the concern, in this study, a rather straightforward Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-integrated take-home assessment technique is proposed, and the outcome of its practice is discussed. Despite involving AI, in the form of ChatGPT, the assessment adheres to the convention of posing questions invoking critical thinking and problem solving skills. However, AI is characteristically integrated in this assessment by instructing the learners to employ ChatGPT as one of the primary sources. The learners are directed to report the use of ChatGPT by including both the prompts and its responses, before expressing their thoughts on AI-generated answers and their own concluding statement. These three characteristic components of the present techniques -- the handling of ChatGPT through the prompts, comments on the AI-responses and the concluding thoughts -- are evaluated to gauge the learning.   The proposed assessment was assigned as a take-home group activity for a batch of seventy eight students, divided into thirteen groups. Despite addressing the same questions, there was no significant overlap in the answers. Moreover, a wide range of approaches were adopted by the groups in handling ChatGPT, which in-turn rendered different responses, ultimately drawing distinct answers. Besides preventing the undesired use of ChatGPT by explicitly integrating it, the proposed assessment seemingly helped the learners question the accuracy of its responses. This self-realised skepticism can be expected to curtail blatant malpractices involving ChatGPT in the long run.

However, whether SAM can be adapted to 3D vision tasks has yet to be explored, especially 3D object detection. With this inspiration, we explore adapting the zero-shot ability of SAM to 3D object detection in this paper. We propose a SAM-powered BEV processing pipeline to detect objects and get promising results on the large-scale Waymo open dataset.

However, most existing math reasoning datasets may be not able to fully evaluate and analyze the ability of LLMs in manipulating tools and performing reasoning, as they may only require very few invocations of tools or miss annotations for evaluating intermediate reasoning steps. To address the issue, we construct \textbf{CARP}, a new Chinese dataset consisting of 4,886 computation-intensive algebra problems with formulated annotations on intermediate steps. In CARP, we test four LLMs with CoT prompting, and find that they are all prone to make mistakes at the early steps of the solution, leading to wrong answers. Based on this finding, we propose a new approach that can deliberate the reasoning steps with tool interfaces, namely \textbf{DELI}. In DELI, we first initialize a step-by-step solution based on retrieved exemplars, then iterate two deliberation procedures that check and refine the intermediate steps of the generated solution, from the perspectives of tool manipulation and natural language reasoning, until obtaining converged solutions or reaching the maximum turn. Experimental results on CARP and six other datasets show that the proposed DELI mostly outperforms competitive baselines, and can further boost the performance of existing CoT methods.

  Dou, Jun Wang, Ji-Rong Wen",When Large Language Model based Agent Meets User Behavior Analysis: A Novel User Simulation Paradigm,"26 pages, 9 figures",,,,cs.IR cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  User behavior analysis is crucial in human-centered AI applications. In this field, the collection of sufficient and high-quality user behavior data has always been a fundamental yet challenging problem. An intuitive idea to address this problem is automatically simulating the user behaviors. However, due to the subjective and complex nature of human cognitive processes, reliably simulating the user behavior is difficult. Recently, large language models (LLM) have obtained remarkable successes, showing great potential to achieve human-like intelligence. We argue that these models present significant opportunities for reliable user simulation, and have the potential to revolutionize traditional study paradigms in user behavior analysis. In this paper, we take recommender system as an example to explore the potential of using LLM for user simulation. Specifically, we regard each user as an LLM-based autonomous agent, and let different agents freely communicate, behave and evolve in a virtual simulator called RecAgent. For comprehensively simulation, we not only consider the behaviors within the recommender system (\emph{e.g.}, item browsing and clicking), but also accounts for external influential factors, such as, friend chatting and social advertisement. Our simulator contains at most 1000 agents, and each agent is composed of a profiling module, a memory module and an action module, enabling it to behave consistently, reasonably and reliably. In addition, to more flexibly operate our simulator, we also design two global functions including real-human playing and system intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our simulator, we conduct extensive experiments from both agent and system perspectives. In order to advance this direction, we have released our project at {https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Rec}.

  https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/Video-LLaMA",,,,cs.CL cs.CV cs.SD eess.AS,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We present Video-LLaMA, a multi-modal framework that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capability of understanding both visual and auditory content in the video. Video-LLaMA bootstraps cross-modal training from the frozen pre-trained visual & audio encoders and the frozen LLMs. Unlike previous vision-LLMs that focus on static image comprehensions such as MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA, Video-LLaMA mainly tackles two challenges in video understanding: (1) capturing the temporal changes in visual scenes, (2) integrating audio-visual signals. To counter the first challenge, we propose a Video Q-former to assemble the pre-trained image encoder into our video encoder and introduce a video-to-text generation task to learn video-language correspondence. For the second challenge, we leverage ImageBind, a universal embedding model aligning multiple modalities as the pre-trained audio encoder, and introduce an Audio Q-former on top of ImageBind to learn reasonable auditory query embeddings for the LLM module. To align the output of both visual & audio encoders with LLM's embedding space, we train Video-LLaMA on massive video/image-caption pairs as well as visual-instruction-tuning datasets of moderate amount but higher quality. We found Video-LLaMA showcases the ability to perceive and comprehend video content, generating meaningful responses that are grounded in the visual and auditory information presented in the videos. This highlights the potential of Video-LLaMA as a promising prototype for audio-visual AI assistants.

However, while various methods have been proposed to augment LLMs with retrieved knowledge and enhance the quality of code generation, the performance of these retrieval-based methods is limited by the strength of the retrievers used. In addition, while LLMs show great emergent ability, they still struggle to produce the correct code in one turn. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-step pipeline, called \autoknow, that leverages LLMs as both knowledge providers and self-reflective programmers. Unlike retrieval-based methods, \autoknow~obtains the knowledge from input prompts and generates intermediate code based on the generated knowledge. After that, \autoknow~asks LLM to act as an expert programmer to perform debugging for the generated code. This is achieved by receiving the error message from the interpreter, without requiring special test cases for correctness verification. We evaluate \autoknow~on three code generation datasets, including DS-1000 for data science code, HumanEval for software engineering code, and TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation. Our empirical experiments show that \autoknow~outperforms strong baselines by a significant margin on all datasets. We also conduct exhaustive analytical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the two stages of \autoknow, and find that both are superior to other prompting-based methods. Further scalability analysis demonstrates that \autoknow~can be adapted to other more advanced models, such as GPT-4, and bring consistent efficacy improvement.

Since untrimmed video contains highly redundant contents, the quality of the query is crucial for accurately localizing moments, i.e., the query should provide precise information about the target moment so that the localization model can understand what to look for in the videos. However, the natural language queries in current datasets may not be easy to understand for existing models. For example, the Ego4D dataset uses question sentences as the query to describe relatively complex moments. While being natural and straightforward for humans, understanding such question sentences are challenging for mainstream moment localization models like 2D-TAN. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially their ability of understanding and generating complex natural language contents, in this extended abstract, we make early attempts at reformulating the moment queries into a set of instructions using large language models and making them more friendly to the localization models.

  Xiaodong Lin",Prompt Space Optimizing Few-shot Reasoning Success with Large Language Models,Natural language processing (NLP),,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Prompt engineering is an essential technique for enhancing the abilities of large language models (LLMs) by providing explicit and specific instructions. It enables LLMs to excel in various tasks, such as arithmetic reasoning, question answering, summarization, relation extraction, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. Researchers have been actively exploring different prompt engineering strategies, such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Zero-CoT, and In-context learning. However, an unresolved problem arises from the fact that current approaches lack a solid theoretical foundation for determining optimal prompts. To address this issue in prompt engineering, we propose a new and effective approach called Prompt Space. Our methodology utilizes text embeddings to obtain basis vectors by matrix decomposition, and then constructs a space for representing all prompts. Prompt Space significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt paradigms on ten public reasoning benchmarks. Notably, without the help of the CoT method and the prompt ""Let's think step by step"", Prompt Space shows superior performance over the few-shot method. Overall, our approach provides a robust and fundamental theoretical framework for selecting simple and effective prompts. This advancement marks a significant step towards improving prompt engineering for a wide variety of applications in LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:43:16 GMT'}]",2023-06-07,"[['Shi', 'Fobo', ''], ['Qing', 'Peijun', ''], ['Yang', 'Dong', ''], ['Wang', 'Nan', ''], ['Lei', 'Youbo', ''], ['Lu', 'Haonan', ''], ['Lin', 'Xiaodong', '']]",0,0,2023-06-06,1,7,1,0,0,0,2d338cdd12091814dec11155d3f6f848d7bab4d8,259088958.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d338cdd12091814dec11155d3f6f848d7bab4d8,arXiv.org,2023.0,42.0,3.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2212609873', 'name': 'Fobo Shi'}, {'authorId': '2188984699', 'name': 'Peijun Qing'}, {'authorId': '144041880', 'name': 'D.

In this article, leading scientists, researchers and engineers discuss the transformative effects of ChatGPT on modern education. This research seeks to improve our knowledge of ChatGPT capabilities and its use in the education sector, identifying potential concerns and challenges. Our preliminary evaluation concludes that ChatGPT performed differently in each subject area including finance, coding and maths. While ChatGPT has the ability to help educators by creating instructional content, offering suggestions and acting as an online educator to learners by answering questions and promoting group work, there are clear drawbacks in its use, such as the possibility of producing inaccurate or false data and circumventing duplicate content (plagiarism) detectors where originality is essential. The often reported hallucinations within Generative AI in general, and also relevant for ChatGPT, can render its use of limited benefit where accuracy is essential. What ChatGPT lacks is a stochastic measure to help provide sincere and sensitive communication with its users. Academic regulations and evaluation practices used in educational institutions need to be updated, should ChatGPT be used as a tool in education. To address the transformative effects of ChatGPT on the learning environment, educating teachers and students alike about its capabilities and limitations will be crucial.

We show that by simply involving a large language model in an iterative process, the output quality improves beyond mere translation. Extensive test scenarios with GPT-3.5 reveal that although iterations reduce string-based metric scores, neural metrics indicate comparable if not improved translation quality. Further, human evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively reduces translationese compared to initial GPT translations and even human references, especially for into-English directions. Ablation studies underscore the importance of anchoring the refinement process to the source input and a reasonable initial translation.

Youku-mPLUG contains 10 million Chinese video-text pairs filtered from 400 million raw videos across a wide range of 45 diverse categories for large-scale pre-training. In addition, to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of video-language models, we carefully build the largest human-annotated Chinese benchmarks covering three popular video-language tasks of cross-modal retrieval, video captioning, and video category classification. Youku-mPLUG can enable researchers to conduct more in-depth multimodal research and develop better applications in the future. Furthermore, we release popular video-language pre-training models, ALPRO and mPLUG-2, and our proposed modularized decoder-only model mPLUG-video pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG. Experiments show that models pre-trained on Youku-mPLUG gain up to 23.1% improvement in video category classification. Besides, mPLUG-video achieves a new state-of-the-art result on these benchmarks with 80.5% top-1 accuracy in video category classification and 68.9 CIDEr score in video captioning, respectively.

Large-scale language models (LLMs) are starting to be used for cell representation learning. However, current LLM-based cell representation learning methods depend solely on the BERT architecture, causing an anisotropic embedding space that leads to inefficient semantic representation. Contrastive learning alleviates this problem by distributing the embeddings uniformly. As a larger batch size in contrastive learning results in better representation, the practical application of contrastive learning in cell representation learning is hampered by the high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data and the large parameter volume of LLMs. To address the batch size limitation, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer contrastive learning approach to decouple the batch size from the GPU memory size for cell representation learning. Based on our divide-and-conquer contrastive learning approach, we introduce Single-Cell Language Model CellLM, a large-scale cell representation learning model to handle high-dimensional scRNA-seq data with tens of thousands of genes. CellLM has over 50 million parameters trained with 2 million scRNA-seq data and makes the first attempt to learn cell language models from both normal cells and cancer cells. CellLM achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in all evaluated downstream tasks: including a 71.8 F_1-score for cell type annotation (a 3.0% absolute improvement over scBERT), an average F_1-score of 88.9 for single-cell drug sensitivity prediction in a few-shot scenario (an 8.3% absolute improvement), and a 93.4 Pearson's correlation for single-omics cell line drug sensitivity prediction (a 6.2% absolute improvement).

A popular implementation is to concatenate a few questions and their correct answers through simple templates, informing LLM of the desired output. In this paper, we propose a novel way of employing labeled data such that it also informs LLM of some undesired output, by extending demonstration examples with feedback about answers predicted by an off-the-shelf model, e.g., correct, incorrect, or incomplete. Experiments on three multi-span question answering datasets as well as a keyphrase extraction dataset show that our new prompting strategy consistently improves LLM's in-context learning performance.

StudentEval contains 1,749 prompts for 48 problems, written by 80 students who have only completed one semester of Python programming. Our students wrote these prompts while working interactively with a Code LLM, and we observed very mixed success rates. We use StudentEval to evaluate 5 Code LLMs and find that StudentEval is a better discriminator of model performance than existing benchmarks. We analyze the prompts and find significant variation in students' prompting techniques. We also find that nondeterministic LLM sampling could mislead students into thinking that their prompts are more (or less) effective than they actually are, which has implications for how to teach with Code LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Wed, 7 Jun 2023 16:03:55 GMT'}]",2023-06-08,"[['Babe', 'Hannah McLean', ''], ['Nguyen', 'Sydney', ''], ['Zi', 'Yangtian', ''], ['Guha', 'Arjun', ''], ['Feldman', 'Molly Q', ''], ['Anderson', 'Carolyn Jane', '']]",0,0,2023-06-07,1,6,3,0,0,0,a4929de687f3c6937dabbf733258af635781d3c4,259095478.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4929de687f3c6937dabbf733258af635781d3c4,arXiv.org,2023.0,27.0,6.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2219267303', 'name': 'Hannah McLean Babe'}, {'authorId': '2181287609', 'name': 'S.

We find that the distribution shift settings in previous studies commonly lack adequate challenges, hindering the accurate evaluation of OOD robustness. To address these issues, we propose a benchmark construction protocol that ensures clear differentiation and challenging distribution shifts. Then we introduce BOSS, a Benchmark suite for Out-of-distribution robustneSS evaluation covering 5 tasks and 20 datasets. Based on BOSS, we conduct a series of experiments on pre-trained language models for analysis and evaluation of OOD robustness. First, for vanilla fine-tuning, we examine the relationship between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance. We identify three typical types that unveil the inner learning mechanism, which could potentially facilitate the forecasting of OOD robustness, correlating with the advancements on ID datasets. Then, we evaluate 5 classic methods on BOSS and find that, despite exhibiting some effectiveness in specific cases, they do not offer significant improvement compared to vanilla fine-tuning. Further, we evaluate 5 LLMs with various adaptation paradigms and find that when sufficient ID data is available, fine-tuning domain-specific models outperform LLMs on ID examples significantly. However, in the case of OOD instances, prioritizing LLMs with in-context learning yields better results. We identify that both fine-tuned small models and LLMs face challenges in effectively addressing downstream tasks. The code is public at \url{https://github.com/lifan-yuan/OOD_NLP}.

Yet, effective VLP demands large-scale image-text pairs, a resource that suffers scarcity in the medical domain. Moreover, conventional VLP is limited to 2D images while medical images encompass diverse modalities, often in 3D, making the learning process more challenging. To address these challenges, we present Generative Text-Guided 3D Vision-Language Pretraining for Unified Medical Image Segmentation (GTGM), a framework that extends of VLP to 3D medical images without relying on paired textual descriptions. Specifically, GTGM utilizes large language models (LLM) to generate medical-style text from 3D medical images. This synthetic text is then used to supervise 3D visual representation learning. Furthermore, a negative-free contrastive learning objective strategy is introduced to cultivate consistent visual representations between augmented 3D medical image patches, which effectively mitigates the biases associated with strict positive-negative sample pairings. We evaluate GTGM on three imaging modalities - Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM) over 13 datasets.

Second, it identifies financial information environments as prime candidates for future disruption via synthetic text modalities, proposing an experimental survey for measuring the influential power of synthetic financial text on global investment communities. Rather than merely assessing the ability of survey participants to distinguish genuine from synthetic text, the experiment contained within this study measures synthetic media influence by observing its ability to manipulate belief via a series of behavioral variables. The results indicate that synthetic text can significantly shift investor sentiment away from what it might otherwise have been under truthful information conditions.

  He",K2: A Foundation Language Model for Geoscience Knowledge Understanding and Utilization,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in general domains of natural language processing. In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model.

  Yue Zhang",PandaLM: An Automatic Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Instruction Tuning Optimization,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task, owing to the complexity of hyperparameter selection and the difficulty involved in evaluating the tuned models. To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated with evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges, we introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained to distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75% of GPT-3.5's evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT-4's in terms of F1-score on our test dataset. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca's hyperparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data leakage. All resources of PandaLM are released at https://github.com/WeOpenML/PandaLM.

To this end, we introduce M3Exam, a novel benchmark sourced from real and official human exam questions for evaluating LLMs in a multilingual, multimodal, and multilevel context. M3Exam exhibits three unique characteristics: (1) multilingualism, encompassing questions from multiple countries that require strong multilingual proficiency and cultural knowledge; (2) multimodality, accounting for the multimodal nature of many exam questions to test the model's multimodal understanding capability; and (3) multilevel structure, featuring exams from three critical educational periods to comprehensively assess a model's proficiency at different levels. In total, M3Exam contains 12,317 questions in 9 diverse languages with three educational levels, where about 23\% of the questions require processing images for successful solving. We assess the performance of top-performing LLMs on M3Exam and find that current models, including GPT-4, still struggle with multilingual text, particularly in low-resource and non-Latin script languages. Multimodal LLMs also perform poorly with complex multimodal questions. We believe that M3Exam can be a valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating LLMs by examining their multilingual and multimodal abilities and tracking their development. Data and evaluation code is available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/M3Exam}.

This problem can be alleviated by augmenting LLMs with information retrieval (IR) systems (also known as retrieval-augmented LLMs). Applying this strategy, LLMs can generate more factual texts in response to user input according to the relevant content retrieved by IR systems from external corpora as references. In addition, by incorporating external knowledge, retrieval-augmented LLMs can answer in-domain questions that cannot be answered by solely relying on the world knowledge stored in parameters. To support research in this area and facilitate the development of retrieval-augmented LLM systems, we develop RETA-LLM, a {RET}reival-{A}ugmented LLM toolkit. In RETA-LLM, we create a complete pipeline to help researchers and users build their customized in-domain LLM-based systems. Compared with previous retrieval-augmented LLM systems, RETA-LLM provides more plug-and-play modules to support better interaction between IR systems and LLMs, including {request rewriting, document retrieval, passage extraction, answer generation, and fact checking} modules. Our toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-IR/tree/main/RETA-LLM.

  Cao, Le Sun",ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Enabling large language models to utilize real-world tools effectively is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Existing approaches to tool learning have either primarily relied on extremely large language models, such as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or utilized supervised learning to train limited scopes of tools on compact models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can achieve generalized tool-use abilities without tool-specific training. To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework designed to automatically generate a diverse tool-use corpus and learn generalized tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention. Specifically, ToolAlpaca first automatically creates a highly diversified tool-use corpus by building a multi-agent simulation environment. The corpus contains 3938 tool-use instances from more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories. Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize previously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use capabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like GPT-3.5, demonstrating that learning generalized tool-use ability is feasible for compact language models.

We first construct the large-scale multi-task instruction data considering a variety of financial tasks, financial document types, and financial data modalities. We then propose a financial LLM called FinMA by fine-tuning LLaMA with the constructed dataset to be able to follow instructions for various financial tasks. To support the evaluation of financial LLMs, we propose a standardized benchmark that covers a set of critical financial tasks, including five financial NLP tasks and one financial prediction task. With this benchmark, we conduct a detailed analysis of FinMA and several existing LLMs, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses in handling critical financial tasks.

Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users.

However, the scarcity of labelled medical image-report pairs presents great challenges in the development of deep and large-scale neural networks capable of harnessing the potential artificial general intelligence power like large language models (LLMs). In this work, we propose customizing off-the-shelf general-purpose large-scale pre-trained models, i.e., foundation models (FMs), in computer vision and natural language processing with a specific focus on medical report generation. Specifically, following BLIP-2, a state-of-the-art vision-language pre-training approach, we introduce our encoder-decoder-based MRG model. This model utilizes a lightweight query Transformer to connect two FMs: the giant vision Transformer EVA-ViT-g and a bilingual LLM trained to align with human intentions (referred to as ChatGLM-6B). Furthermore, we conduct ablative experiments on the trainable components of the model to identify the crucial factors for effective transfer learning. Our findings demonstrate that unfreezing EVA-ViT-g to learn medical image representations, followed by parameter-efficient training of ChatGLM-6B to capture the writing styles of medical reports, is essential for achieving optimal results.

In natural language processing (NLP) domains, large language model (LLM) has shown astonishing emergent abilities (e.g., instruction following, reasoning), thus giving rise to the promising research direction of adapting LLM to RS for performance enhancements and user experience improvements. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on this research direction from an application-oriented view. We first summarize existing research works from two orthogonal perspectives: where and how to adapt LLM to RS. For the ""WHERE"" question, we discuss the roles that LLM could play in different stages of the recommendation pipeline, i.e., feature engineering, feature encoder, scoring/ranking function, and pipeline controller. For the ""HOW"" question, we investigate the training and inference strategies, resulting in two fine-grained taxonomy criteria, i.e., whether to tune LLMs or not, and whether to involve conventional recommendation model (CRM) for inference. Detailed analysis and general development trajectories are provided for both questions, respectively. Then, we highlight key challenges in adapting LLM to RS from three aspects, i.e., efficiency, effectiveness, and ethics. Finally, we summarize the survey and discuss the future prospects. We also actively maintain a GitHub repository for papers and other related resources in this rising direction: https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-LLM-for-RecSys.

Trained on a large segmentation dataset of over 1 billion masks, SAM is capable of segmenting any object on a certain image. In the original SAM work, the authors turned to zero-short transfer tasks (like edge detection) for evaluating the performance of SAM. Recently, numerous works have attempted to investigate the performance of SAM in various scenarios to recognize and segment objects. Moreover, numerous projects have emerged to show the versatility of SAM as a foundation model by combining it with other models, like Grounding DINO, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, etc. With the relevant papers and projects increasing exponentially, it is challenging for the readers to catch up with the development of SAM. To this end, this work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on SAM. This is an ongoing project and we intend to update the manuscript on a regular basis. Therefore, readers are welcome to contact us if they complete new works related to SAM so that we can include them in our next version.

However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.

Traditional methods for molecule discovery follow a trial-and-error process, which are both time-consuming and costly, while computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as revolutionary tools to expedite various tasks, like molecule-caption translation. Despite the importance of molecule-caption translation for molecule discovery, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, and suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their great powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and reasoning, which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. To address the above limitations, in this work, we propose a novel LLMs-based framework (\textbf{MolReGPT}) for molecule-caption translation, where a retrieval-based prompt paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT without fine-tuning. More specifically, MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to ground the generation of LLMs through in-context few-shot molecule learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT via molecule-caption translation, which includes molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that MolReGPT outperforms fine-tuned models like MolT5-base without any additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery.

However, existing methods are mainly restricted to specifically designed tools and fail to fulfill complex instructions, having great limitations when confronted with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore a more realistic scenario by connecting LLMs with RESTful APIs, which adhere to the widely adopted REST software architectural style for web service development. To address the practical challenges of tackling complex instructions, we propose RestGPT, which exploits the power of LLMs and conducts a coarse-to-fine online planning mechanism to enhance the abilities of task decomposition and API selection. RestGPT also contains an API executor tailored for calling RESTful APIs, which can meticulously formulate parameters and parse API responses. To fully evaluate the performance of RestGPT, we propose RestBench, a high-quality benchmark which consists of two real-world scenarios and human-annotated instructions with gold solution paths.

The process of developing such models is straightforward yet effective. It involves pre-training an adaptation module to align the semantics of the vision encoder and language model, followed by fine-tuning on the instruction-following data. However, despite the success of this pipeline in image and language understanding, its effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been widely explored. In this paper, we aim to develop a novel multi-modal foundation model capable of perceiving video, image, and language within a general framework. To achieve this goal, we introduce Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced ability. Specifically, our proposed Valley model is designed with a simple projection module that bridges video, image, and language modalities, and is further unified with a multi-lingual LLM. We also collect multi-source vision-text pairs and adopt a spatio-temporal pooling strategy to obtain a unified vision encoding of video and image input for pre-training. Furthermore, we generate multi-task instruction-following video data, including multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal relationship inference, etc. To obtain the instruction-following data, we design diverse rounds of task-oriented conversations between humans and videos, facilitated by ChatGPT. Qualitative examples demonstrate that our proposed model has the potential to function as a highly effective multilingual video assistant that can make complex video understanding scenarios easy.

There is a natural demand for humans to manage, process, and display data efficiently. However, it necessitates labor-intensive efforts and a high level of expertise for these data-related tasks. Considering that large language models (LLMs) have showcased promising capabilities in semantic understanding and reasoning, we advocate that the deployment of LLMs could autonomously manage and process massive amounts of data while displaying and interacting in a human-friendly manner. Based on this belief, we propose Data-Copilot, an LLM-based system that connects numerous data sources on one end and caters to diverse human demands on the other end. Acting like an experienced expert, Data-Copilot autonomously transforms raw data into visualization results that best match the user's intent. Specifically, Data-Copilot autonomously designs versatile interfaces (tools) for data management, processing, prediction, and visualization. In real-time response, it automatically deploys a concise workflow by invoking corresponding interfaces step by step for the user's request. The interface design and deployment processes are fully controlled by Data-Copilot itself, without human assistance. Besides, we create a Data-Copilot demo that links abundant data from different domains (stock, fund, company, economics, and live news) and accurately respond to diverse requests, serving as a reliable AI assistant.

As the first fully automated movie generation model to the best of our knowledge, our approach empowers users to create captivating movies with smooth transitions using simple text inputs, surpassing existing methods that produce soundless videos limited to a single scene of modest quality. To facilitate this distinctive functionality, we leverage ChatGPT to expand user-provided text into detailed sequential scripts for movie generation. Then we bring scripts to life visually and acoustically through vision generation and audio retrieval. To generate videos, we extend the capabilities of a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model through a two-stage process. Firstly, we employ spatial finetuning to bridge the gap between the pretrained image model and the new video dataset. Subsequently, we introduce temporal learning to capture object motion. In terms of audio, we leverage sophisticated retrieval models to select and align audio elements that correspond to the plot and visual content of the movie. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MovieFactory produces movies with realistic visuals, diverse scenes, and seamlessly fitting audio, offering users a novel and immersive experience. Generated samples can be found in YouTube or Bilibili (1080P).

However, ChatGPT could bring ethical challenges, encompassing plagiarism, privacy, data security, and the risk of generating biased or potentially detrimental data. This research aims to fill the given gap by elaborating on the key elements: motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature survey, identified the mentioned elements, and presented their relationships by developing a taxonomy. Further, the identified literature-based elements (motivators, demotivators, and ethical principles) were empirically evaluated by conducting a comprehensive questionnaire-based survey involving SE researchers. Additionally, we employed Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) approach to analyze the relationships between the ethical principles of using ChatGPT in SE research and develop a level based decision model. We further conducted a Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to create a cluster-based decision model. These models aim to help SE researchers devise effective strategies for ethically integrating ChatGPT into SE research by following the identified principles through adopting the motivators and addressing the demotivators. The findings of this study will establish a benchmark for incorporating ChatGPT services in SE research with an emphasis on ethical considerations.

Moving one step forward, considering a system with human-in-the-loop involves more than having humans improve performance but also controlling the cost. Therefore, we post a Cost-utility Analysis Model for Human-in-the-Loop systems (CAMLOP) based on classical economics theory to analyze, quantify and balance the utility and the corresponding cost.

As a result, the general public utilize them as an influential tool for boosting their productivity while natural language processing researchers endeavor to employ them in solving existing or new research problems. Unfortunately, individuals can only access such powerful AIs through APIs, which ultimately leads to the transmission of raw data to the models' providers and increases the possibility of privacy data leakage. Current privacy-preserving methods for cloud-deployed language models aim to protect privacy information in the pre-training dataset or during the model training phase. However, they do not meet the specific challenges presented by the remote access approach of new large-scale language models.   This paper introduces a novel task, ""User Privacy Protection for Dialogue Models,"" which aims to safeguard sensitive user information from any possible disclosure while conversing with chatbots. We also present an evaluation scheme for this task, which covers evaluation metrics for privacy protection, data availability, and resistance to simulation attacks. Moreover, we propose the first framework for this task, namely privacy protection through text sanitization. Before sending the input to remote large models, it filters out the sensitive information, using several rounds of text sanitization based on privacy types that users define. Upon receiving responses from the larger model, our framework automatically restores privacy to ensure that the conversation goes smoothly, without intervention from the privacy filter. Experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our privacy-preserving approach against eavesdropping from potential attackers.

However, previous KD methods are primarily applied to white-box classification models or training small models to imitate black-box model APIs like ChatGPT. How to effectively distill the knowledge from white-box generative LLMs is still under-explored, which becomes more and more important with the prosperity of LLMs. In this work, we propose MiniLLM that distills smaller language models from generative larger language models. We first replace the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD on generative language models, to prevent the student model from overestimating the low-probability regions of the teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective optimization approach to learn this objective. Extensive experiments in the instruction-following setting show that the MiniLLM models generate more precise responses with the higher overall quality, lower exposure bias, better calibration, and higher long-text generation performance. Our method is also scalable for different model families with 120M to 13B parameters. We will release our code and model checkpoints at https://aka.ms/MiniLLM.

Existing approaches either fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on annotated data or use prompts to guide fixed large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. PLMs can perform well in schema alignment but struggle to achieve complex reasoning, while LLMs is superior in complex reasoning tasks but cannot achieve precise schema alignment. In this paper, we propose a ZeroNL2SQL framework that combines the complementary advantages of PLMs and LLMs for supporting zero-shot NL2SQL. ZeroNL2SQL first uses PLMs to generate an SQL sketch via schema alignment, then uses LLMs to fill the missing information via complex reasoning. Moreover, in order to better align the generated SQL queries with values in the given database instances, we design a predicate calibration method to guide the LLM in completing the SQL sketches based on the database instances and select the optimal SQL query via an execution-based strategy. Comprehensive experiments show that ZeroNL2SQL can achieve the best zero-shot NL2SQL performance on real-world benchmarks. Specifically, ZeroNL2SQL outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based methods by 3.2% to 13% and exceeds LLM-based methods by 10% to 20% on execution accuracy.

Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building a LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of $8$ representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates $6$ categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and embodied artificial intelligence on $47$ standard text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study reveals several innovative findings. First, instruction-tuned LVLM with massive in-domain data such as InstructBLIP heavily overfits many existing tasks, generalizing poorly in the open-world scenario. Second, instruction-tuned LVLM with moderate instruction-following data may result in object hallucination issues (i.e., generate objects that are inconsistent with target images in the descriptions). It either makes the current evaluation metric such as CIDEr for image captioning ineffective or generates wrong answers. Third, employing a multi-turn reasoning evaluation framework can mitigate the issue of object hallucination, shedding light on developing an effective pipeline for LVLM evaluation. The findings provide a foundational framework for the conception and assessment of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing zero-shot multimodal techniques.

Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For ability modeling, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering $19$ tasks. (2) For data, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For evaluation criteria, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge hallucination. We evaluate $21$ open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset and open-participation leaderboard are publicly released at https://kola.xlore.cn and will be continuously updated to provide references for developing LLMs and knowledge-related systems.

While the pre-trained models can perform many tasks, such models are often fine-tuned to improve their performance on various downstream applications. However, this leads to issues over violation of model licenses, model theft, and copyright infringement. Moreover, recent advances show that generative technology is capable of producing harmful content which exacerbates the problems of accountability within model supply chains. Thus, we need a method to investigate how a model was trained or a piece of text was generated and what their pre-trained base model was. In this paper we take the first step to address this open problem by tracing back the origin of a given fine-tuned LLM to its corresponding pre-trained base model. We consider different knowledge levels and attribution strategies, and find that we can correctly trace back 8 out of the 10 fine tuned models with our best method.

However, existing multimodal development frameworks either do not handle the complexity and compositionality of multimodal commands well or require developers to write a substantial amount of code to support these multimodal interactions. In this paper, we present ReactGenie, a programming framework that uses a shared object-oriented state abstraction to support building complex multimodal mobile applications. Having different modalities share the same state abstraction allows developers using ReactGenie to seamlessly integrate and compose these modalities to deliver multimodal interaction.   ReactGenie is a natural extension to the existing workflow of building a graphical app, like the workflow with React-Redux. Developers only have to add a few annotations and examples to indicate how natural language is mapped to the user-accessible functions in the program. ReactGenie automatically handles the complex problem of understanding natural language by generating a parser that leverages large language models.   We evaluated the ReactGenie framework by using it to build three demo apps. We evaluated the accuracy of the language parser using elicited commands from crowd workers and evaluated the usability of the generated multimodal app with 16 participants. Our results show that ReactGenie can be used to build versatile multimodal applications with highly accurate language parsers, and the multimodal app can lower users' cognitive load and task completion time.

Lowering the threshold for LLMs training would encourage greater participation from researchers, benefiting both academia and society.

In this work, we propose a new optimizer, LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), which fuses the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. By integrating LOMO with existing memory saving techniques, we reduce memory usage to 10.8% compared to the standard approach (DeepSpeed solution).

Nevertheless, existing CKGs are typically oriented to English, limiting the research in non-English languages. Meanwhile, the emergence of foundation models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has shown promising intelligence with the help of reinforcement learning from human feedback. Under the background, in this paper, we utilize foundation models to construct a Chinese CKG, named Snowman. Specifically, we distill different types of commonsense head items from ChatGPT, and continue to use it to collect tail items with respect to the head items and pre-defined relations. Based on the preliminary analysis, we find the negative commonsense knowledge distilled by ChatGPT achieves lower human acceptance compared to other knowledge. Therefore, we design a simple yet effective self-instruct filtering strategy to filter out invalid negative commonsense. Overall, the constructed Snowman covers more than ten million Chinese commonsense triples, making it the largest Chinese CKG. Moreover, human studies show the acceptance of Snowman achieves 90.6\%, indicating the high-quality triples distilled by the cutting-edge foundation model. We also conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge models to show the usability and effectiveness of our Snowman.

Most agents rely on massive diverse training data to achieve better generalization, which requires expensive labor. These agents often focus on common objects and fewer tasks, thus are not intelligent enough to handle different types of instructions. To facilitate research in open-set vision-and-language navigation, we propose a benchmark named MO-VLN, aiming at testing the effectiveness and generalization of the agent in the multi-task setting. First, we develop a 3D simulator rendered by realistic scenarios using Unreal Engine 5, containing more realistic lights and details. The simulator contains three scenes, i.e., cafe, restaurant, and nursing house, of high value in the industry. Besides, our simulator involves multiple uncommon objects, such as takeaway cup and medical adhesive tape, which are more complicated compared with existing environments. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna), we construct diverse high-quality data of instruction type without human annotation. Our benchmark MO-VLN provides four tasks: 1) goal-conditioned navigation given a specific object category (e.g., ""fork""); 2) goal-conditioned navigation given simple instructions (e.g., ""Search for and move towards a tennis ball""); 3) step-by-step instruction following; 4) finding abstract object based on high-level instruction (e.g., ""I am thirsty"").

For comparing these abilities of different models, several benchmarks (i.e. sets of standard test questions) from different fields (e.g., Literature, Biology and Psychology) are often adopted and the test results under traditional metrics such as accuracy, recall and F1, are reported. However, such way for evaluating LLMs can be inefficient and inaccurate from the cognitive science perspective. Inspired by Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) used in psychometrics, we propose an adaptive testing framework for LLM evaluation. Rather than using a standard test set and simply reporting accuracy, this approach dynamically adjusts the characteristics of the test questions, such as difficulty, based on the model's performance. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the model's abilities, using fewer questions. More importantly, it allows LLMs to be compared with humans easily, which is essential for NLP models that aim for human-level ability. Our diagnostic reports have found that ChatGPT often behaves like a ``careless student'', prone to slip and occasionally guessing the questions. We conduct a fine-grained diagnosis and rank the latest 6 instruction-tuned LLMs from three aspects of Subject Knowledge, Mathematical Reasoning, and Programming, where GPT4 can outperform other models significantly and reach the cognitive ability of middle-level students. Different tests for different models using efficient adaptive testing -- we believe this has the potential to become a new norm in evaluating large language models.

  Tang, Weinan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Yong Yu",Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models,,,,,cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recommender systems play a vital role in various online services. However, the insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific domain limits their access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capability. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders have not achieved satisfactory results. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs -- the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms.

Advancing from foundation LLMs to instructionfollowing LLMs, instruction tuning plays a vital role in aligning LLMs to human preferences. However, the existing LLMs are usually focused on English, leading to inferior performance in non-English languages. In order to improve the performance for non-English languages, it is necessary to collect language-specific training data for foundation LLMs and construct language-specific instructions for instruction tuning, both of which are heavy loads. To minimize human workload, we propose to transfer the capabilities of language generation and instruction following from English to other languages through an interactive translation task. We have developed BayLing, an instruction-following LLM by utilizing LLaMA as the foundation LLM and automatically constructing interactive translation instructions for instructing tuning. Extensive assessments demonstrate that BayLing achieves comparable performance to GPT-3.5-turbo, despite utilizing a considerably smaller parameter size of only 13 billion. Experimental results on translation tasks show that BayLing achieves 95% of single-turn translation capability compared to GPT-4 with automatic evaluation and 96% of interactive translation capability compared to GPT-3.5-turbo with human evaluation. To estimate the performance on general tasks, we created a multi-turn instruction test set called BayLing-80. The experimental results on BayLing-80 indicate that BayLing achieves 89% of performance compared to GPT-3.5-turbo. BayLing also demonstrates outstanding performance on knowledge assessment of Chinese GaoKao and English SAT, second only to GPT-3.5-turbo among a multitude of instruction-following LLMs. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose \textbf{JiuZhang~2.0}, a unified Chinese PLM specially for multi-task mathematical problem solving. Our idea is to maintain a moderate-sized model and employ the \emph{cross-task knowledge sharing} to improve the model capacity in a multi-task setting. Specially, we construct a Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture for modeling mathematical text, so as to capture the common mathematical knowledge across tasks. For optimizing the MoE architecture, we design \emph{multi-task continual pre-training} and \emph{multi-task fine-tuning} strategies for multi-task adaptation. These training strategies can effectively decompose the knowledge from the task data and establish the cross-task sharing via expert networks. In order to further improve the general capacity of solving different complex tasks, we leverage large language models~(LLMs) as complementary models to iteratively refine the generated solution by our PLM, via in-context learning.

This belief applies to the current status of understanding deep neural networks including large language models and even the biological intelligence. Toy models provide a metaphor of physical reality, allowing mathematically formulating that reality (i.e., the so-called theory), which can be updated as more conjectures are justified or refuted. One does not need to pack all details into a model, but rather, more abstract models are constructed, as complex systems like brains or deep networks have many sloppy dimensions but much less stiff dimensions that strongly impact macroscopic observables. This kind of bottom-up mechanistic modeling is still promising in the modern era of understanding the natural or artificial intelligence.

We propose a general pipeline for the RM-PRT benchmark that takes as input multimodal prompts containing natural language instructions and automatically outputs actions containing the movement and position transitions. We set four natural language understanding tasks with progressive reasoning levels and evaluate the robot's ability to understand natural language instructions in two modes of adsorption and grasping.

However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization, our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and is also favored by GPT-4.

Some researchers suggest that LLMs could potentially replace structured knowledge bases like knowledge graphs (KGs) and function as parameterized knowledge bases. However, while LLMs are proficient at learning probabilistic language patterns based on large corpus and engaging in conversations with humans, they, like previous smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), still have difficulty in recalling facts while generating knowledge-grounded contents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed enhancing data-driven PLMs with knowledge-based KGs to incorporate explicit factual knowledge into PLMs, thus improving their performance to generate texts requiring factual knowledge and providing more informed responses to user queries. This paper reviews the studies on enhancing PLMs with KGs, detailing existing knowledge graph enhanced pre-trained language models (KGPLMs) as well as their applications. Inspired by existing studies on KGPLM, this paper proposes to enhance LLMs with KGs by developing knowledge graph-enhanced large language models (KGLLMs).

It is crucial to prioritize human-centered principles when utilizing these models. Safeguarding the ethical and moral compliance of LLMs is of utmost importance. However, individual ethical issues have not been well studied on the latest LLMs. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps by introducing a new benchmark -- TrustGPT. TrustGPT provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in three crucial areas: toxicity, bias, and value-alignment. Initially, TrustGPT examines toxicity in language models by employing toxic prompt templates derived from social norms. It then quantifies the extent of bias in models by measuring quantifiable toxicity values across different groups. Lastly, TrustGPT assesses the value of conversation generation models from both active value-alignment and passive value-alignment tasks. Through the implementation of TrustGPT, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the performance of conversation generation models and promote the development of language models that are more ethical and socially responsible.

2306.11585,Minghua He,"Minghua He, Nanfei Gu, Yuntao Shi, Qionghui Zhang, Yaying Chen",FAIR: A Causal Framework for Accurately Inferring Judgments Reversals,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Artificial intelligence researchers have made significant advances in legal intelligence in recent years. However, the existing studies have not focused on the important value embedded in judgments reversals, which limits the improvement of the efficiency of legal intelligence. In this paper, we propose a causal Framework for Accurately Inferring case Reversals (FAIR), which models the problem of judgments reversals based on real Chinese judgments. We mine the causes of judgments reversals by causal inference methods and inject the obtained causal relationships into the neural network as a priori knowledge. And then, our framework is validated on a challenging dataset as a legal judgment prediction task. The experimental results show that our framework can tap the most critical factors in judgments reversal, and the obtained causal relationships can effectively improve the neural network's performance. In addition, we discuss the generalization ability of large language models for legal intelligence tasks using ChatGPT as an example. Our experiment has found that the generalization ability of large language models still has defects, and mining causal relationships can effectively improve the accuracy and explain ability of model predictions.

Yet, while the literature on the trustworthiness of GPT models remains limited, practitioners have proposed employing capable GPT models for sensitive applications to healthcare and finance - where mistakes can be costly. To this end, this work proposes a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation for large language models with a focus on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, considering diverse perspectives - including toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution robustness, robustness on adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. Based on our evaluations, we discover previously unpublished vulnerabilities to trustworthiness threats. For instance, we find that GPT models can be easily misled to generate toxic and biased outputs and leak private information in both training data and conversation history. We also find that although GPT-4 is usually more trustworthy than GPT-3.5 on standard benchmarks, GPT-4 is more vulnerable given jailbreaking system or user prompts, potentially due to the reason that GPT-4 follows the (misleading) instructions more precisely. Our work illustrates a comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation of GPT models and sheds light on the trustworthiness gaps. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://decodingtrust.github.io/.

  Jian Yin, Hongyang Chao, Qi Zhang",Learning Profitable NFT Image Diffusions via Multiple Visual-Policy Guided Reinforcement Learning,Accepted by ACM-MM 2023,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We study the task of generating profitable Non-Fungible Token (NFT) images from user-input texts. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for image generation. However, existing works can fall short in generating visually-pleasing and highly-profitable NFT images, mainly due to the lack of 1) plentiful and fine-grained visual attribute prompts for an NFT image, and 2) effective optimization metrics for generating high-quality NFT images. To solve these challenges, we propose a Diffusion-based generation framework with Multiple Visual-Policies as rewards (i.e., Diffusion-MVP) for NFT images. The proposed framework consists of a large language model (LLM), a diffusion-based image generator, and a series of visual rewards by design. First, the LLM enhances a basic human input (such as ""panda"") by generating more comprehensive NFT-style prompts that include specific visual attributes, such as ""panda with Ninja style and green background."" Second, the diffusion-based image generator is fine-tuned using a large-scale NFT dataset to capture fine-grained image styles and accessory compositions of popular NFT elements. Third, we further propose to utilize multiple visual-policies as optimization goals, including visual rarity levels, visual aesthetic scores, and CLIP-based text-image relevances. This design ensures that our proposed Diffusion-MVP is capable of minting NFT images with high visual quality and market value. To facilitate this research, we have collected the largest publicly available NFT image dataset to date, consisting of 1.5 million high-quality images with corresponding texts and market values. Extensive experiments including objective evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our framework can generate NFT images showing more visually engaging elements and higher market value, compared with SOTA approaches.

  Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li",Retrieving-to-Answer: Zero-Shot Video Question Answering with Frozen Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has been significantly advanced from the scaling of recent Large Language Models (LLMs). The key idea is to convert the visual information into the language feature space so that the capacity of LLMs can be fully exploited. Existing VideoQA methods typically take two paradigms: (1) learning cross-modal alignment, and (2) using an off-the-shelf captioning model to describe the visual data. However, the first design needs costly training on many extra multi-modal data, whilst the second is further limited by limited domain generalization. To address these limitations, a simple yet effective Retrieving-to-Answer (R2A) framework is proposed.Given an input video, R2A first retrieves a set of semantically similar texts from a generic text corpus using a pre-trained multi-modal model (e.g., CLIP). With both the question and the retrieved texts, a LLM (e.g., DeBERTa) can be directly used to yield a desired answer. Without the need for cross-modal fine-tuning, R2A allows for all the key components (e.g., LLM, retrieval model, and text corpus) to plug-and-play. Extensive experiments on several VideoQA benchmarks show that despite with 1.3B parameters and no fine-tuning, our R2A can outperform the 61 times larger Flamingo-80B model even additionally trained on nearly 2.1B multi-modal data.

When it comes to the biochemistry field, a series of tasks around molecules (e.g., property prediction, molecule mining, etc.) are of great significance while having a high technical threshold. Bridging the molecule expressions in natural language and chemical language can not only hugely improve the interpretability and reduce the operation difficulty of these tasks, but also fuse the chemical knowledge scattered in complementary materials for a deeper comprehension of molecules. Based on these benefits, we propose the conversational molecular design, a novel task adopting natural language for describing and editing target molecules. To better accomplish this task, we design ChatMol, a knowledgeable and versatile generative pre-trained model, enhanced by injecting experimental property information, molecular spatial knowledge, and the associations between natural and chemical languages into it. Several typical solutions including large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) are evaluated, proving the challenge of conversational molecular design and the effectiveness of our knowledge enhancement method.

To mitigate this, we propose the concept of AI chain and introduce the best principles and practices that have been accumulated in software engineering for decades into AI chain engineering, to systematise AI chain engineering methodology.

Existing MEL methods mainly focus on designing complex multimodal interaction mechanisms and require fine-tuning all model parameters, which can be prohibitively costly and difficult to scale in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose GEMEL, a simple yet effective Generative Multimodal Entity Linking framework based on LLMs, which directly generates target entity names. We keep the vision and language model frozen and only train a feature mapper to enable cross-modality interactions. To adapt LLMs to the MEL task, we take advantage of the emergent in-context learning capability of LLMs by retrieving multimodal instances as demonstrations. Extensive experiments show that, with only ~0.3% of the model parameters fine-tuned, GEMEL achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established MEL datasets (7.7% accuracy gains on WikiDiverse and 8.8% accuracy gains on WikiMEL). The performance gain stems from mitigating the popularity bias of LLM predictions and disambiguating less common entities effectively. Further analysis verifies the generality and scalability of GEMEL. Our approach is compatible with any off-the-shelf language model, paving the way towards an efficient and general solution for utilizing LLMs in the MEL task.

An Empirical Evaluation of Confidence Elicitation in LLMs,11 Pages,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The task of empowering large language models (LLMs) to accurately express their confidence, referred to as confidence elicitation, is essential in ensuring reliable and trustworthy decision-making processes. Previous methods, which primarily rely on model logits, have become less suitable for LLMs and even infeasible with the rise of closed-source LLMs (e.g., commercialized LLM APIs). This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of \emph{non-logit-based} approaches to estimate the uncertainty of LLMs. Hence, in this study, we investigate approaches for confidence elicitation that do not require model fine-tuning or access to proprietary information. We introduce three categories of methods: verbalize-based, consistency-based, and their hybrid methods for benchmarking, and evaluate their performance across five types of datasets and four widely-used LLMs. Our analysis of these methods uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs often exhibit a high degree of overconfidence when verbalizing their confidence; 2) Prompting strategies such as CoT, Top-K and Multi-step confidences improve calibration of verbalized confidence; 3) Consistency-based methods outperform the verbalized confidences in most cases, with particularly notable improvements on the arithmetic reasoning task; 4) Hybrid methods consistently deliver the best performance over their baselines, thereby emerging as a promising state-of-the-art approach; 5) Despite these advancements, all investigated methods continue to struggle with challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, leaving significant scope for improvement of confidence elicitation.

This discourse primarily revolves around harnessing the remarkable comprehension capabilities of LLMs to extract sentiment factors which facilitate informed and high-frequency investment portfolio adjustments. To ensure successful implementations of these LLMs into the analysis of Chinese financial texts and the subsequent trading strategy development within the Chinese stock market, we provide a rigorous and encompassing benchmark as well as a standardized back-testing framework aiming at objectively assessing the efficacy of various types of LLMs in the specialized domain of sentiment factor extraction from Chinese news text data. To illustrate how our benchmark works, we reference three distinctive models: 1) the generative LLM (ChatGPT), 2) the Chinese language-specific pre-trained LLM (Erlangshen-RoBERTa), and 3) the financial domain-specific fine-tuned LLM classifier(Chinese FinBERT). We apply them directly to the task of sentiment factor extraction from large volumes of Chinese news summary texts. We then proceed to building quantitative trading strategies and running back-tests under realistic trading scenarios based on the derived sentiment factors and evaluate their performances with our benchmark. By constructing such a comparative analysis, we invoke the question of what constitutes the most important element for improving a LLM's performance on extracting sentiment factors. And by ensuring that the LLMs are evaluated on the same benchmark, following the same standardized experimental procedures that are designed with sufficient expertise in quantitative trading, we make the first stride toward answering such a question.

The advent of graph neural networks, such as the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN), demonstrates the possibility of directly mapping the relationship between material structures and properties without employing empirical descriptors. Another exciting recent advancement is in large language models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, which demonstrates competency at reading comprehension tasks and holds great promise for accelerating the acquisition of databases on material properties. Here, we utilize the combination of GPT-4 and CGCNN to develop rare-earth doped phosphors for solid-state lighting. GPT-4 is applied to data-mine chemical formulas and emission wavelengths of 264 Eu(II)-doped phosphors from 274 papers. A CGCNN model is trained on the acquired dataset, achieving a test $R^2$ of 0.77. The model is then used to screen over 40,000 inorganic materials to make predictions on the emission wavelengths. We also demonstrate the possibility of leveraging transfer learning to fine-tune a bandgap-predicting CGCNN model towards the prediction of phosphor emission wavelengths. The workflow requires minimal human supervision, little domain knowledge about phosphors, and is generalizable to other material properties.

To systematically study the robustness of Table QA models, we propose a benchmark called RobuT, which builds upon existing Table QA datasets (WTQ, WikiSQL-Weak, and SQA) and includes human-annotated adversarial perturbations in terms of table header, table content, and question. Our results indicate that both state-of-the-art Table QA models and large language models (e.g., GPT-3) with few-shot learning falter in these adversarial sets.

This paper specifically aims to distinguish code generated by ChatGPT from that authored by humans. Our investigation reveals disparities in programming style, technical level, and readability between these two sources. Consequently, we develop a discriminative feature set for differentiation and evaluate its efficacy through ablation experiments. Additionally, we devise a dataset cleansing technique, which employs temporal and spatial segmentation, to mitigate the dearth of datasets and to secure high-caliber, uncontaminated datasets. To further enrich data resources, we employ ""code transformation,"" ""feature transformation,"" and ""feature customization"" techniques, generating an extensive dataset comprising 10,000 lines of ChatGPT-generated code. The salient contributions of our research include: proposing a discriminative feature set yielding high accuracy in differentiating ChatGPT-generated code from human-authored code in binary classification tasks; devising methods for generating extensive ChatGPT-generated codes; and introducing a dataset cleansing strategy that extracts immaculate, high-grade code datasets from open-source repositories, thus achieving exceptional accuracy in code authorship attribution tasks.

Fortunately, human motion displays a semantic coupling akin to human language, often perceived as a form of body language. By fusing language data with large-scale motion models, motion-language pre-training that can enhance the performance of motion-related tasks becomes feasible. Driven by this insight, we propose MotionGPT, a unified, versatile, and user-friendly motion-language model to handle multiple motion-relevant tasks. Specifically, we employ the discrete vector quantization for human motion and transfer 3D motion into motion tokens, similar to the generation process of word tokens. Building upon this ""motion vocabulary"", we perform language modeling on both motion and text in a unified manner, treating human motion as a specific language. Moreover, inspired by prompt learning, we pre-train MotionGPT with a mixture of motion-language data and fine-tune it on prompt-based question-and-answer tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionGPT achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple motion tasks including text-driven motion generation, motion captioning, motion prediction, and motion in-between.

Specifically, we represent refer expressions as links in Markdown, i.e., ``[text span](bounding boxes)'', where object descriptions are sequences of location tokens. Together with multimodal corpora, we construct large-scale data of grounded image-text pairs (called GrIT) to train the model. In addition to the existing capabilities of MLLMs (e.g., perceiving general modalities, following instructions, and performing in-context learning), Kosmos-2 integrates the grounding capability into downstream applications. We evaluate Kosmos-2 on a wide range of tasks, including (i) multimodal grounding, such as referring expression comprehension, and phrase grounding, (ii) multimodal referring, such as referring expression generation, (iii) perception-language tasks, and (iv) language understanding and generation. This work lays out the foundation for the development of Embodiment AI and sheds light on the big convergence of language, multimodal perception, action, and world modeling, which is a key step toward artificial general intelligence.

In turn, the other person can then respond by referring to specific regions if necessary. This natural referential ability in dialogue remains absent in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To fill this gap, this paper proposes an MLLM called Shikra, which can handle spatial coordinate inputs and outputs in natural language. Its architecture consists of a vision encoder, an alignment layer, and a LLM. It is designed to be straightforward and simple, without the need for extra vocabularies, position encoder, pre-/post-detection modules, or external plug-in models. All inputs and outputs are in natural language form. Referential dialogue is a superset of various vision-language (VL) tasks. Shikra can naturally handle location-related tasks like REC and PointQA, as well as conventional VL tasks such as Image Captioning and VQA. Experimental results showcase Shikra's promising performance. Furthermore, it enables numerous exciting applications, like providing mentioned objects' coordinates in chains of thoughts and comparing user-pointed regions similarities.

In this paper, we proposed IDOL (InDicator-Oriented Logic Pre-training), an easy-to-understand but highly effective further pre-training task which logically strengthens the pre-trained models with the help of 6 types of logical indicators and a logically rich dataset LGP (LoGic Pre-training). IDOL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReClor and LogiQA, the two most representative benchmarks in logical reasoning MRC, and is proven to be capable of generalizing to different pre-trained models and other types of MRC benchmarks like RACE and SQuAD 2.0 while keeping competitive general language understanding ability through testing on tasks in GLUE. Besides, at the beginning of the era of large language models, we take several of them like ChatGPT into comparison and find that IDOL still shows its advantage.

  Shun Chen, Bin Liu, Jianhua Tao",Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning,,,,,cs.MM cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Multimodal emotion recognition is an active research topic in artificial intelligence. Its primary objective is to integrate multi-modalities (such as acoustic, visual, and lexical clues) to identify human emotional states. Current works generally assume accurate emotion labels for benchmark datasets and focus on developing more effective architectures. But due to the inherent subjectivity of emotions, existing datasets often lack high annotation consistency, resulting in potentially inaccurate labels. Consequently, models built on these datasets may struggle to meet the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, it is crucial to enhance the reliability of emotion annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel task called ``\textbf{Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER)}''. In contrast to previous works that primarily focus on predicting emotions, EMER takes a step further by providing explanations for these predictions. The prediction is considered correct as long as the reasoning process behind the predicted emotion is plausible. This paper presents our initial efforts on EMER, where we introduce a benchmark dataset, establish baseline models, and define evaluation metrics. Meanwhile, we observe the necessity of integrating multi-faceted capabilities to deal with EMER. Therefore, we propose the first multimodal large language model (LLM) in affective computing, called \textbf{AffectGPT}. We aim to tackle the long-standing challenge of label ambiguity and chart a path toward more reliable techniques. Furthermore, EMER offers an opportunity to evaluate the audio-video-text understanding capabilities of recent multimodal LLM.

However, existing open-source libraries suffer from various limitations, which impede their practical use in challenging scenarios where large-scale training is necessary. While industrial systems from OpenAI and DeepMind have achieved successful large-scale RL training, their system architecture and implementation details remain undisclosed to the community. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction on the dataflows of RL training, which unifies practical RL training across diverse applications into a general framework and enables fine-grained optimizations. Following this abstraction, we develop a scalable, efficient, and extensible distributed RL system called ReaLly Scalable RL (SRL). The system architecture of SRL separates major RL computation components and allows massively parallelized training. Moreover, SRL offers user-friendly and extensible interfaces for customized algorithms. Our evaluation shows that SRL outperforms existing academic libraries in both a single machine and a medium-sized cluster. In a large-scale cluster, the novel architecture of SRL leads to up to 3.7x speedup compared to the design choices adopted by the existing libraries. We also conduct a direct benchmark comparison to OpenAI's industrial system, Rapid, in the challenging hide-and-seek environment. SRL reproduces the same solution as reported by OpenAI with up to 5x speedup in wall-clock time.

Recent research on LLM performance in various causal discovery and inference tasks has given rise to a new ladder in the classical three-stage framework of causality. In this paper, we advance the current research of LLM-driven causal discovery by proposing a novel framework that combines knowledge-based LLM causal analysis with data-driven causal structure learning. To make LLM more than a query tool and to leverage its power in discovering natural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable LLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into statistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and practical baseline for causal structure learning.   We introduce a universal set of prompts designed to extract causal graphs from given variables and assess the influence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal structures from data. We demonstrate the significant enhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recovered causal structures from data, while also identifying critical challenges and issues, along with potential approaches to address them. As a pioneering study, this paper aims to emphasize the new frontier that LLMs are opening for classical causal discovery and inference, and to encourage the widespread adoption of LLM capabilities in data-driven causal analysis.

2306.17177,Mohammad Belal,"Mohammad Belal, James She, Simon Wong",Leveraging ChatGPT As Text Annotation Tool For Sentiment Analysis,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Sentiment analysis is a well-known natural language processing task that involves identifying the emotional tone or polarity of a given piece of text. With the growth of social media and other online platforms, sentiment analysis has become increasingly crucial for businesses and organizations seeking to monitor and comprehend customer feedback as well as opinions. Supervised learning algorithms have been popularly employed for this task, but they require human-annotated text to create the classifier. To overcome this challenge, lexicon-based tools have been used. A drawback of lexicon-based algorithms is their reliance on pre-defined sentiment lexicons, which may not capture the full range of sentiments in natural language. ChatGPT is a new product of OpenAI and has emerged as the most popular AI product. It can answer questions on various topics and tasks. This study explores the use of ChatGPT as a tool for data labeling for different sentiment analysis tasks. It is evaluated on two distinct sentiment analysis datasets with varying purposes. The results demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms other lexicon-based unsupervised methods with significant improvements in overall accuracy. Specifically, compared to the best-performing lexical-based algorithms, ChatGPT achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of 20% for the tweets dataset and approximately 25% for the Amazon reviews dataset. These findings highlight the exceptional performance of ChatGPT in sentiment analysis tasks, surpassing existing lexicon-based approaches by a significant margin. The evidence suggests it can be used for annotation on different sentiment analysis events and taskss.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been employed to achieve this alignment by combining a reward model, typically based on Bradley-Terry paired comparison, with an RL algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize LLM responses. However, RLHF exhibits complexity, instability, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose Preference Ranking Optimization (PRO) as an alternative to PPO for directly aligning LLMs with the Bradley-Terry comparison. PRO extends the pairwise Bradley-Terry comparison to accommodate preference rankings of any length. By iteratively contrasting the likelihood of generating responses, PRO instructs the LLM to prioritize the best response while progressively ranking the remaining responses. In this manner, PRO effectively transforms human alignment into aligning the probability ranking of $n$ responses generated by LLM with the preference ranking of humans towards these responses. Experiments have shown that PRO outperforms existing alignment algorithms, achieving comparable results to ChatGPT and human responses through automatic-based, reward-based, GPT-4, and human evaluations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that longer, more diverse, and higher-quality preference ranking sequences can consistently enhance the performance of human alignment.

It can be conceptualized as a machine translation task, wherein the objective is to rephrase a given query into a more comprehensive alternative. While showing promising results, training such a model typically requires a large parallel corpus of query pairs (i.e., the original query and a reformulated query) that are confidential and unpublished by online code search engines. This restricts its practicality in software development processes. In this paper, we propose SSQR, a self-supervised query reformulation method that does not rely on any parallel query corpus. Inspired by pre-trained models, SSQR treats query reformulation as a masked language modeling task conducted on an extensive unannotated corpus of queries. SSQR extends T5 (a sequence-to-sequence model based on Transformer) with a new pre-training objective named corrupted query completion (CQC), which randomly masks words within a complete query and trains T5 to predict the masked content. Subsequently, for a given query to be reformulated, SSQR identifies potential locations for expansion and leverages the pre-trained T5 model to generate appropriate content to fill these gaps. The selection of expansions is then based on the information gain associated with each candidate. Evaluation results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms unsupervised baselines significantly and achieves competitive performance compared to supervised methods.

Previous work has explored how to ground LLMs in robotic tasks to generate feasible and executable textual plans. However, low-level execution in the physical world may deviate from the high-level textual plan due to environmental perturbations or imperfect controller design. In this paper, we propose \textbf{DoReMi}, a novel language model grounding framework that enables immediate Detection and Recovery from Misalignments between plan and execution. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to play a dual role, aiding not only in high-level planning but also generating constraints that can indicate misalignment during execution. Then vision language models (VLMs) are utilized to detect constraint violations continuously. Our pipeline can monitor the low-level execution and enable timely recovery if certain plan-execution misalignment occurs. Experiments on various complex tasks including robot arms and humanoid robots demonstrate that our method can lead to higher task success rates and shorter task completion times.

However, existing IE toolkits have several non-trivial problems, such as not supporting multi-tasks, not supporting automatic updates. In this work, we present CollabKG, a learnable human-machine-cooperative IE toolkit for KG and EKG construction. Specifically, for the multi-task issue, CollabKG unifies different IE subtasks, including named entity recognition (NER), entity-relation triple extraction (RE), and event extraction (EE), and supports both KG and EKG. Then, combining advanced prompting-based IE technology, the human-machine-cooperation mechanism with LLMs as the assistant machine is presented which can provide a lower cost as well as a higher performance. Lastly, owing to the two-way interaction between the human and machine, CollabKG with learning ability allows self-renewal. Besides, CollabKG has several appealing features (e.g., customization, training-free, propagation, etc.) that make the system powerful, easy-to-use, and high-productivity. We holistically compare our toolkit with other existing tools on these features. Human evaluation quantitatively illustrates that CollabKG significantly improves annotation quality, efficiency, and stability simultaneously.

Yet, during this process, a side effect, which we termed as the ""multi-modal alignment tax"", surfaces. This side effect negatively impacts the model's ability to format responses appropriately -- for instance, its ""politeness"" -- due to the overly succinct and unformatted nature of raw annotations, resulting in reduced human preference. In this paper, we introduce Polite Flamingo, a multi-modal response rewriter that transforms raw annotations into a more appealing, ""polite"" format. Polite Flamingo is trained to reconstruct high-quality responses from their automatically distorted counterparts and is subsequently applied to a vast array of vision-language datasets for response rewriting. After rigorous filtering, we generate the PF-1M dataset and further validate its value by fine-tuning a multi-modal LLM with it. Combined with novel methodologies including U-shaped multi-stage tuning and multi-turn augmentation, the resulting model, Clever Flamingo, demonstrates its advantages in both multi-modal understanding and response politeness according to automated and human evaluations.

Our research is derived from the heuristic facts that tokens are created unequally in reflecting the meaning of generations by auto-regressive LLMs, i.e., some tokens are more relevant (or representative) than others, yet all the tokens are equally valued when estimating uncertainty. It is because of the linguistic redundancy where mostly a few keywords are sufficient to convey the meaning of a long sentence. We name these inequalities as generative inequalities and investigate how they affect uncertainty estimation. Our results reveal that considerable tokens and sentences containing limited semantics are weighted equally or even heavily when estimating uncertainty. To tackle these biases posed by generative inequalities, we propose to jointly Shifting Attention to more Relevant (SAR) components from both the token level and the sentence level while estimating uncertainty. We conduct experiments over popular ""off-the-shelf"" LLMs (e.g., OPT, LLaMA) with model sizes up to 30B and powerful commercial LLMs (e.g., Davinci from OpenAI), across various free-form question-answering tasks.

We attribute their overestimation of token-level repetition probabilities to the learning bias: LMs capture simple repetitive patterns faster with the MLE loss. We propose self-contrastive training to penalize the output of a premature checkpoint of the same model when it incorrectly predicts repetition, which is shown to mitigate repetition effectively while maintaining fluency on two datasets. Furthermore, we find that LMs use longer-range dependencies to predict repetitive tokens than non-repetitive ones, which may be the cause of sentence-level repetition loops.

Recent large language models (LLM) can embed rich semantic knowledge for agents in plan generation of complex tasks, while they lack the information about the realistic world and usually yield infeasible action sequences. In this paper, we propose a TAsk Planing Agent (TaPA) in embodied tasks for grounded planning with physical scene constraint, where the agent generates executable plans according to the existed objects in the scene by aligning LLMs with the visual perception models. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans, where we provide the designed prompts and the list of existing objects in the scene for GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding planned actions. The generated data is leveraged for grounded plan tuning of pre-trained LLMs. During inference, we discover the objects in the scene by extending open-vocabulary object detectors to multi-view RGB images collected in different achievable locations. Experimental results show that the generated plan from our TaPA framework can achieve higher success rate than LLaVA and GPT-3.5 by a sizable margin, which indicates the practicality of embodied task planning in general and complex environments.

  Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2023",,,,eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Zero-shot medical image classification is a critical process in real-world scenarios where we have limited access to all possible diseases or large-scale annotated data. It involves computing similarity scores between a query medical image and possible disease categories to determine the diagnostic result. Recent advances in pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown great performance for zero-shot natural image recognition and exhibit benefits in medical applications. However, an explainable zero-shot medical image recognition framework with promising performance is yet under development. In this paper, we propose a novel CLIP-based zero-shot medical image classification framework supplemented with ChatGPT for explainable diagnosis, mimicking the diagnostic process performed by human experts. The key idea is to query large language models (LLMs) with category names to automatically generate additional cues and knowledge, such as disease symptoms or descriptions other than a single category name, to help provide more accurate and explainable diagnosis in CLIP. We further design specific prompts to enhance the quality of generated texts by ChatGPT that describe visual medical features. Extensive results on one private dataset and four public datasets along with detailed analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of our training-free zero-shot diagnosis pipeline, corroborating the great potential of VLMs and LLMs for medical applications.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.

Predominantly, current job recommendations deploy either collaborative filtering or person-job matching strategies. However, these models tend to operate as ""black-box"" systems and lack the capacity to offer explainable guidance to job seekers. Moreover, conventional matching-based recommendation methods are limited to retrieving and ranking existing jobs in the database, restricting their potential as comprehensive career AI advisors. To this end, here we present GIRL (GeneratIve job Recommendation based on Large language models), a novel approach inspired by recent advancements in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). We initially employ a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy to instruct the LLM-based generator in crafting suitable Job Descriptions (JDs) based on the Curriculum Vitae (CV) of a job seeker. Moreover, we propose to train a model which can evaluate the matching degree between CVs and JDs as a reward model, and we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to further fine-tine the generator. This aligns the generator with recruiter feedback, tailoring the output to better meet employer preferences. In particular, GIRL serves as a job seeker-centric generative model, providing job suggestions without the need of a candidate set. This capability also enhances the performance of existing job recommendation models by supplementing job seeking features with generated content. With extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, we demonstrate the substantial effectiveness of our approach. We believe that GIRL introduces a paradigm-shifting approach to job recommendation systems, fostering a more personalized and comprehensive job-seeking experience.

These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to various advancements and impacts across several domains.   We consider the in-context learning under two formulation for attention related regression in this work. Given matrices $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, and $A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, the purpose is to solve some certain optimization problems: Normalized version $\min_{X} \| D(X)^{-1} \exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) - B \|_F^2$ and Rescaled version $\| \exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) - D(X) \cdot B \|_F^2$. Here $D(X) := \mathrm{diag}( \exp(A_1 X A_2^\top) {\bf 1}_n )$.   Our regression problem shares similarities with previous studies on softmax-related regression. Prior research has extensively investigated regression techniques related to softmax regression: Normalized version $\| \langle \exp(Ax) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b \|_2^2$ and Resscaled version $\| \exp(Ax) - \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle b \|_2^2 $   In contrast to previous approaches, we adopt a vectorization technique to address the regression problem in matrix formulation. This approach expands the dimension from $d$ to $d^2$, resembling the formulation of the regression problem mentioned earlier.   Upon completing the lipschitz analysis of our regression function, we have derived our main result concerning in-context learning.

We demonstrate that recent LLMs, such as GPT-4, can surpass strong planning-based methods and exhibit emergent effective communication using our framework without requiring fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. We also discover that LLM-based agents that communicate in natural language can earn more trust and cooperate more effectively with humans.

Nevertheless, without in-domain training, these models tend to ignore fine-grained OCR features, such as sophisticated tables or large blocks of text, which are essential for OCR-free document understanding. In this paper, we propose mPLUG-DocOwl based on mPLUG-Owl for OCR-free document understanding.

As AD impairs the patient's language understanding and expression ability, the speech of AD patients can serve as an indicator of this disease. This study investigates various methods for detecting AD using patients' speech and transcripts data from the DementiaBank Pitt database. The proposed approach involves pre-trained language models and Graph Neural Network (GNN) that constructs a graph from the speech transcript, and extracts features using GNN for AD detection. Data augmentation techniques, including synonym replacement, GPT-based augmenter, and so on, were used to address the small dataset size. Audio data was also introduced, and WavLM model was used to extract audio features. These features were then fused with text features using various methods. Finally, a contrastive learning approach was attempted by converting speech transcripts back to audio and using it for contrastive learning with the original audio. We conducted intensive experiments and analysis on the above methods. Our findings shed light on the challenges and potential solutions in AD detection using speech and audio data.

2307.02599,Shuyang Cai,Shuyang Cai and Wanyun Cui,Evade ChatGPT Detectors via A Single Space,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  ChatGPT brings revolutionary social value but also raises concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content. Consequently, an important question is how to detect whether content is generated by ChatGPT or by human. Existing detectors are built upon the assumption that there are distributional gaps between human-generated and AI-generated content. These gaps are typically identified using statistical information or classifiers. Our research challenges the distributional gap assumption in detectors. We find that detectors do not effectively discriminate the semantic and stylistic gaps between human-generated and AI-generated content. Instead, the ""subtle differences"", such as an extra space, become crucial for detection. Based on this discovery, we propose the SpaceInfi strategy to evade detection. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy across multiple benchmarks and detectors. We also provide a theoretical explanation for why SpaceInfi is successful in evading perplexity-based detection. Our findings offer new insights and challenges for understanding and constructing more applicable ChatGPT detectors.

In this article, we introduce an autonomous edge AI system that automatically organizes, adapts, and optimizes itself to meet users' diverse requirements. The system employs a cloud-edge-client hierarchical architecture, where the large language model, i.e., Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), resides in the cloud, and other AI models are co-deployed on devices and edge servers. By leveraging the powerful abilities of GPT in language understanding, planning, and code generation, we present a versatile framework that efficiently coordinates edge AI models to cater to users' personal demands while automatically generating code to train new models via edge federated learning.

  https://llm-eval.github.io/",,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, educations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey.

However, these benchmarks have encountered two major limitations. On the one hand, most of them require human annotation of knowledge, which leads to limited knowledge coverage. On the other hand, they usually use choices or spans in the texts as the answers, which results in narrow answer space. To overcome these limitations, we build a new challenging benchmark named KoRc in this paper. Compared with previous benchmarks, KoRC has two advantages, i.e., broad knowledge coverage and flexible answer format. Specifically, we utilize massive knowledge bases to guide annotators or large language models (LLMs) to construct knowledgable questions. Moreover, we use labels in knowledge bases rather than spans or choices as the final answers. We test state-of-the-art models on KoRC and the experimental results show that the strongest baseline only achieves 68.3% and 30.0% F1 measure in the in-distribution and out-of-distribution test set, respectively. These results indicate that deep text understanding is still an unsolved challenge. The benchmark dataset, leaderboard, and baseline methods are released in https://github.com/THU-KEG/KoRC.

The most popular pipeline for learning on graphs with textual node attributes primarily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and utilizes shallow text embedding as initial node representations, which has limitations in general knowledge and profound semantic understanding. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to possess extensive common knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities that have revolutionized existing workflows to handle text data. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs in graph machine learning, especially the node classification task, and investigate two possible pipelines: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. The former leverages LLMs to enhance nodes' text attributes with their massive knowledge and then generate predictions through GNNs. The latter attempts to directly employ LLMs as standalone predictors. We conduct comprehensive and systematical studies on these two pipelines under various settings. From comprehensive empirical results, we make original observations and find new insights that open new possibilities and suggest promising directions to leverage LLMs for learning on graphs.

However, their vision-language alignments are only built on image-level, the lack of region-level alignment limits their advancements to fine-grained multimodal understanding. In this paper, we propose instruction tuning on region-of-interest. The key design is to reformulate the bounding box as the format of spatial instruction. The interleaved sequences of visual features extracted by the spatial instruction and the language embedding are input to LLM, and trained on the transformed region-text data in instruction tuning format. Our region-level vision-language model, termed as GPT4RoI, brings brand new conversational and interactive experience beyond image-level understanding. (1) Controllability: Users can interact with our model by both language and spatial instructions to flexibly adjust the detail level of the question. (2) Capacities: Our model supports not only single-region spatial instruction but also multi-region. This unlocks more region-level multimodal capacities such as detailed region caption and complex region reasoning. (3) Composition: Any off-the-shelf object detector can be a spatial instruction provider so as to mine informative object attributes from our model, like color, shape, material, action, relation to other objects, etc. The code, data, and demo can be found at https://github.com/jshilong/GPT4RoI.

We pinpoint several problems with current evaluation methods that tend to overstate the capabilities of LLMs. We then articulate what artificial general intelligence should encompass beyond the capabilities of LLMs. We propose four characteristics of generally intelligent agents: 1) they can perform unlimited tasks; 2) they can generate new tasks within a context; 3) they operate based on a value system that underpins task generation; and 4) they have a world model reflecting reality, which shapes their interaction with the world. Building on this viewpoint, we highlight the missing pieces in artificial general intelligence, that is, the unity of knowing and acting. We argue that active engagement with objects in the real world delivers more robust signals for forming conceptual representations. Additionally, knowledge acquisition isn't solely reliant on passive input but requires repeated trials and errors. We conclude by outlining promising future research directions in the field of artificial general intelligence.

Project page and demos: https://radar.vizhub.ai,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the intensifying popularity of ChatGPT-like applications have blurred the boundary of high-quality text generation between humans and machines. However, in addition to the anticipated revolutionary changes to our technology and society, the difficulty of distinguishing LLM-generated texts (AI-text) from human-generated texts poses new challenges of misuse and fairness, such as fake content generation, plagiarism, and false accusation of innocent writers. While existing works show that current AI-text detectors are not robust to LLM-based paraphrasing, this paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a new framework called RADAR, which jointly trains a Robust AI-text Detector via Adversarial leaRning. RADAR is based on adversarial training of a paraphraser and a detector. The paraphraser's goal is to generate realistic contents to evade AI-text detection. RADAR uses the feedback from the detector to update the paraphraser, and vice versa. Evaluated with 8 different LLMs (Pythia, Dolly 2.0, Palmyra, Camel, GPT-J, Dolly 1.0, LLaMA, and Vicuna) across 4 datasets, experimental results show that RADAR significantly outperforms existing AI-text detection methods, especially when paraphrasing is in place. We also identify the strong transferability of RADAR from instruction-tuned LLMs to other LLMs, and evaluate the improved capability of RADAR via GPT-3.5.

A Preliminary Study,"15 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In recent years, personality has been regarded as a valuable personal factor being incorporated into numerous tasks such as sentiment analysis and product recommendation. This has led to widespread attention to text-based personality recognition task, which aims to identify an individual's personality based on given text. Considering that ChatGPT has recently exhibited remarkable abilities on various natural language processing tasks, we provide a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on text-based personality recognition task for generating effective personality data. Concretely, we employ a variety of prompting strategies to explore ChatGPT's ability in recognizing personality from given text, especially the level-oriented prompting strategy we designed for guiding ChatGPT in analyzing given text at a specified level. The experimental results on two representative real-world datasets reveal that ChatGPT with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting exhibits impressive personality recognition ability and is capable to provide natural language explanations through text-based logical reasoning. Furthermore, by employing the level-oriented prompting strategy to optimize zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, the performance gap between ChatGPT and corresponding state-of-the-art model has been narrowed even more. However, we observe that ChatGPT shows unfairness towards certain sensitive demographic attributes such as gender and age. Additionally, we discover that eliciting the personality recognition ability of ChatGPT helps improve its performance on personality-related downstream tasks such as sentiment classification and stress prediction.

However, some studies indicated that large language models fail to achieve promising result beyond the state-of-the-art models in English grammatical error correction (GEC) tasks. In this report, we aim to explore the how large language models perform on Chinese grammatical error correction tasks and provide guidance for future work. We conduct experiments with 3 different LLMs of different model scale on 4 Chinese GEC dataset. Our experimental results indicate that the performances of LLMs on automatic evaluation metrics falls short of the previous sota models because of the problem of over-correction. Furthermore, we also discover notable variations in the performance of LLMs when evaluated on different data distributions. Our findings demonstrates that further investigation is required for the application of LLMs on Chinese GEC task.

  Zhao",CT-BERT: Learning Better Tabular Representations Through Cross-Table Pre-training,,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Tabular data -- also known as structured data -- is one of the most common data forms in existence, thanks to the stable development and scaled deployment of database systems in the last few decades. At present however, despite the blast brought by large pre-trained models in other domains such as ChatGPT or SAM, how can we extract common knowledge across tables at a scale that may eventually lead to generalizable representation for tabular data remains a full blank. Indeed, there have been a few works around this topic. Most (if not all) of them are limited in the scope of a single table or fixed form of a schema. In this work, we first identify the crucial research challenges behind tabular data pre-training, particularly towards the cross-table scenario. We position the contribution of this work in two folds: (i)-we collect and curate nearly 2k high-quality tabular datasets, each of which is guaranteed to possess clear semantics, clean labels, and other necessary meta information. (ii)-we propose a novel framework that allows cross-table pre-training dubbed as CT-BERT. Noticeably, in light of pioneering the scaled cross-table training, CT-BERT is fully compatible with both supervised and self-supervised schemes, where the specific instantiation of CT-BERT is very much dependent on the downstream tasks. We further propose and implement a contrastive-learning-based and masked table modeling (MTM) objective into CT-BERT, that is inspired from computer vision and natural language processing communities but sophistically tailored to tables. The extensive empirical results on 15 datasets demonstrate CT-BERT's state-of-the-art performance, where both its supervised and self-supervised setups significantly outperform the prior approaches.

2307.04408,Jiali Zeng,Jiali Zeng and Fandong Meng and Yongjing Yin and Jie Zhou,TIM: Teaching Large Language Models to Translate with Comparison,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Open-sourced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various tasks with instruction tuning. However, these models can sometimes struggle with tasks that require more specialized knowledge such as translation. One possible reason for such deficiency is that instruction tuning aims to generate fluent and coherent text that continues from a given instruction without being constrained by any task-specific requirements. Moreover, it can be more challenging for tuning smaller LLMs with lower-quality training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework using examples in comparison to teach LLMs to learn translation. Our approach involves presenting the model with examples of correct and incorrect translations and using a preference loss to guide the model's learning. We evaluate our method on WMT2022 test sets and show that it outperforms existing methods. Our findings offer a new perspective on fine-tuning LLMs for translation tasks and provide a promising solution for generating high-quality translations.

Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model. Based on our main results, we perform a comprehensive analysis of RLHF abilities compared with SFT models and ChatGPT. The absence of open-source implementations has posed significant challenges to the investigation of LLMs alignment.

  Wang and Ting Wang",Retrieval-augmented GPT-3.5-based Text-to-SQL Framework with Sample-aware Prompting and Dynamic Revision Chain,,,,,cs.IR cs.AI cs.DB,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Text-to-SQL aims at generating SQL queries for the given natural language questions and thus helping users to query databases. Prompt learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a recent approach, which designs prompts to lead LLMs to understand the input question and generate the corresponding SQL. However, it faces challenges with strict SQL syntax requirements. Existing work prompts the LLMs with a list of demonstration examples (i.e. question-SQL pairs) to generate SQL, but the fixed prompts can hardly handle the scenario where the semantic gap between the retrieved demonstration and the input question is large. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented prompting method for a LLM-based Text-to-SQL framework, involving sample-aware prompting and a dynamic revision chain. Our approach incorporates sample-aware demonstrations, which include the composition of SQL operators and fine-grained information related to the given question. To retrieve questions sharing similar intents with input questions, we propose two strategies for assisting retrieval. Firstly, we leverage LLMs to simplify the original questions, unifying the syntax and thereby clarifying the users' intentions. To generate executable and accurate SQLs without human intervention, we design a dynamic revision chain which iteratively adapts fine-grained feedback from the previously generated SQL. Experimental results on three Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong baseline models.

Given the outstanding informal reasoning ability of humans, how much informal reasoning ability language models have has not been well studied by scholars.In order to explore the gap between humans and language models in informal reasoning ability, this paper constructs a Detective Reasoning Benchmark, which is an assembly of 1,200 questions gathered from accessible online resources, aims at evaluating the model's informal reasoning ability in real-life context.Considering the improvement of the model's informal reasoning ability restricted by the lack of benchmark, we further propose a Self-Question Prompt Framework that mimics human thinking to enhance the model's informal reasoning ability.The goals of self-question are to find key elements, deeply investigate the connections between these elements, encourage the relationship between each element and the problem, and finally, require the model to reasonably answer the problem.The experimental results show that human performance greatly outperforms the SoTA Language Models in Detective Reasoning Benchmark.Besides, Self-Question is proven to be the most effective prompt engineering in improving GPT-4's informal reasoning ability, but it still does not even surpass the lowest score made by human participants.Upon acceptance of the paper, the source code for the benchmark will be made publicly accessible.

These models have been trained on an extensive dataset that encompasses both simplified and traditional Chinese characters, allowing them to effectively handle various natural language processing tasks related to ancient books, including but not limited to automatic sentence segmentation, punctuation, word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, entity recognition, and automatic translation. Notably, these models have exhibited exceptional performance across a range of validation tasks using publicly available datasets. Our research findings highlight the efficacy of employing self-supervised methods to further train the models using classical text corpora, thus enhancing their capability to tackle downstream tasks. Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that the choice of font, the scale of the corpus, and the initial model selection all exert significant influence over the ultimate experimental outcomes. To cater to the diverse text processing preferences of researchers in digital humanities and linguistics, we have developed three distinct categories comprising a total of nine model variations. We believe that by sharing these foundational language models specialized in the domain of ancient texts, we can facilitate the intelligent processing and scholarly exploration of ancient literary works and, consequently, contribute to the global dissemination of China's rich and esteemed traditional culture in this new era.

Although it has potential to support English as a foreign language (EFL) students' writing, to effectively collaborate with it, a student must learn to engineer prompts, that is, the skill of crafting appropriate instructions so that ChatGPT produces desired outputs. However, writing an appropriate prompt for ChatGPT is not straightforward for non-technical users who suffer a trial-and-error process. This paper examines the content of EFL students' ChatGPT prompts when completing a writing task and explores patterns in the quality and quantity of the prompts. The data come from iPad screen recordings of secondary school EFL students who used ChatGPT and other SOTA chatbots for the first time to complete the same writing task. The paper presents a case study of four distinct pathways that illustrate the trial-and-error process and show different combinations of prompt content and quantity. The cases contribute evidence for the need to provide prompt engineering education in the context of the EFL writing classroom, if students are to move beyond an individual trial-and-error process, learning a greater variety of prompt content and more sophisticated prompts to support their writing.

This paper focuses on unveiling the capability of large language models in understanding behavior graphs and leveraging this understanding to enhance recommendations in online recruitment, including the promotion of out-of-distribution (OOD) application. We present a novel framework that harnesses the rich contextual information and semantic representations provided by large language models to analyze behavior graphs and uncover underlying patterns and relationships. Specifically, we propose a meta-path prompt constructor that leverages LLM recommender to understand behavior graphs for the first time and design a corresponding path augmentation module to alleviate the prompt bias introduced by path-based sequence input. By leveraging this capability, our framework enables personalized and accurate job recommendations for individual users. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive dataset and demonstrate its ability to improve the relevance and quality of recommended quality. This research not only sheds light on the untapped potential of large language models but also provides valuable insights for developing advanced recommendation systems in the recruitment market.

However, how to effectively evaluate these large vision-language models remains a major obstacle, hindering future model development. Traditional benchmarks like VQAv2 or COCO Caption provide quantitative performance measurements but suffer from a lack of fine-grained ability assessment and non-robust evaluation metrics. Recent subjective benchmarks, such as OwlEval, offer comprehensive evaluations of a model's abilities by incorporating human labor, but they are not scalable and display significant bias. In response to these challenges, we propose MMBench, a novel multi-modality benchmark. MMBench methodically develops a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, primarily comprised of two elements. The first element is a meticulously curated dataset that surpasses existing similar benchmarks in terms of the number and variety of evaluation questions and abilities. The second element introduces a novel CircularEval strategy and incorporates the use of ChatGPT. This implementation is designed to convert free-form predictions into pre-defined choices, thereby facilitating a more robust evaluation of the model's predictions. MMBench is a systematically-designed objective benchmark for robustly evaluating the various abilities of vision-language models. We hope MMBench will assist the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in this domain. Project page: https://opencompass.org.cn/mmbench.

Our research focuses on the innovative application of a differentiable logic loss in the training to leverage the co-occurrence relations between verb and noun, as well as the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the logic rules for the adaptation to unseen action labels. Specifically, the model's predictions are treated as the truth assignment of a co-occurrence logic formula to compute the logic loss, which measures the consistency between the predictions and the logic constraints. By using the verb-noun co-occurrence matrix generated from the dataset, we observe a moderate improvement in model performance compared to our baseline framework. To further enhance the model's adaptability to novel action labels, we experiment with rules generated using GPT-3.5, which leads to a slight decrease in performance. These findings shed light on the potential and challenges of incorporating differentiable logic and LLMs for knowledge extraction in unsupervised domain adaptation for action recognition. Our final submission (entitled `NS-LLM') achieved the first place in terms of top-1 action recognition accuracy.

We argue that traditional optimization-based and modular autonomous driving (AD) systems face inherent performance limitations when dealing with long-tail corner cases. To address this problem, we propose that an ideal AD system should drive like a human, accumulating experience through continuous driving and using common sense to solve problems. To achieve this goal, we identify three key abilities necessary for an AD system: reasoning, interpretation, and memorization. We demonstrate the feasibility of employing an LLM in driving scenarios by building a closed-loop system to showcase its comprehension and environment-interaction abilities. Our extensive experiments show that the LLM exhibits the impressive ability to reason and solve long-tailed cases, providing valuable insights for the development of human-like autonomous driving.

There have been several heated discussions on the intersection of LLMs and wireless technologies. While recent studies have demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate hardware description language (HDL) code for simple computation tasks, developing wireless prototypes and products via HDL poses far greater challenges because of the more complex computation tasks involved. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by investigating the role of LLMs in FPGA-based hardware development for advanced wireless signal processing. We begin by exploring LLM-assisted code refactoring, reuse, and validation, using an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) project as a case study. Through the case study, we find that an LLM assistant can potentially yield substantial productivity gains for researchers and developers. We then examine the feasibility of using LLMs to generate HDL code for advanced wireless signal processing, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm as an example. This task presents two unique challenges: the scheduling of subtasks within the overall task and the multi-step thinking required to solve certain arithmetic problem within the task. To address these challenges, we employ in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques, culminating in the successful generation of a 64-point Verilog FFT module. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for generalization and imitation, affirming their usefulness in writing HDL code for wireless communication systems. Overall, this work contributes to understanding the role of LLMs in wireless communication and motivates further exploration of their capabilities.

Conventionally, a molecule graph can be represented either as a graph-structured data or a SMILES text. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of NLP. Although it is natural to utilize LLMs to assist in understanding molecules represented by SMILES, the exploration of how LLMs will impact molecular property prediction is still in its early stage. In this work, we advance towards this objective through two perspectives: zero/few-shot molecular classification, and using the new explanations generated by LLMs as representations of molecules. To be specific, we first prompt LLMs to do in-context molecular classification and evaluate their performance. After that, we employ LLMs to generate semantically enriched explanations for the original SMILES and then leverage that to fine-tune a small-scale LM model for multiple downstream tasks. The experimental results highlight the superiority of text explanations as molecular representations across multiple benchmark datasets, and confirm the immense potential of LLMs in molecular property prediction tasks.

These issues could be partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm ``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.

  Maosong Sun",CPET: Effective Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Compressed Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) has been widely explored in recent years because it tunes much fewer parameters (PET modules) than full-parameter fine-tuning (FT) while still stimulating sufficient knowledge from large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks. Moreover, when PET is employed to serve multiple tasks, different task-specific PET modules can be built on a frozen LLM, avoiding redundant LLM deployments. Although PET significantly reduces the cost of tuning and deploying LLMs, its inference still suffers from the computational bottleneck of LLMs. To address the above issue, we propose an effective PET framework based on compressed LLMs, named ""CPET"". In CPET, we evaluate the impact of mainstream LLM compression techniques on PET performance and then introduce knowledge inheritance and recovery strategies to restore the knowledge loss caused by these compression techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that, owing to the restoring strategies of CPET, collaborating task-specific PET modules with a compressed LLM can achieve comparable performance to collaborating PET modules with the original version of the compressed LLM and outperform directly applying vanilla PET methods to the compressed LLM.

Without gradient updates, these models can rapidly construct new predictors from demonstrations presented in the inputs. Recent works promote this ability in the vision-language domain by incorporating visual information into large language models that can already make in-context predictions. However, these methods could inherit issues in the language domain, such as template sensitivity and hallucination. Also, the scale of these language models raises a significant demand for computations, making learning and operating these models resource-intensive. To this end, we raise a question: ``How can we enable in-context learning without relying on the intrinsic in-context ability of large language models?"". To answer it, we propose a succinct and general framework, Self-supervised IN-Context learning (SINC), that introduces a meta-model to learn on self-supervised prompts consisting of tailored demonstrations. The learned models can be transferred to downstream tasks for making in-context predictions on-the-fly. Extensive experiments show that SINC outperforms gradient-based methods in various vision-language tasks under few-shot settings. Furthermore, the designs of SINC help us investigate the benefits of in-context learning across different tasks, and the analysis further reveals the essential components for the emergence of in-context learning in the vision-language domain.

Recent advancements in deep learning have started to revolutionize software engineering practices through elaborate designs implemented at various stages of software development. In this paper, we present an innovative paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) throughout the entire software development process, streamlining and unifying key processes through natural language communication, thereby eliminating the need for specialized models at each phase. At the core of this paradigm lies ChatDev, a virtual chat-powered software development company that mirrors the established waterfall model, meticulously dividing the development process into four distinct chronological stages: designing, coding, testing, and documenting. Each stage engages a team of agents, such as programmers, code reviewers, and test engineers, fostering collaborative dialogue and facilitating a seamless workflow. The chat chain acts as a facilitator, breaking down each stage into atomic subtasks. This enables dual roles, allowing for proposing and validating solutions through context-aware communication, leading to efficient resolution of specific subtasks. The instrumental analysis of ChatDev highlights its remarkable efficacy in software generation, enabling the completion of the entire software development process in under seven minutes at a cost of less than one dollar. It not only identifies and alleviates potential vulnerabilities but also rectifies potential hallucinations while maintaining commendable efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The potential of ChatDev unveils fresh possibilities for integrating LLMs into the realm of software development.

Many current methods focus on specializing LMs in mathematical reasoning and rely heavily on knowledge distillation from powerful but inefficient large LMs (LLMs). In this work, we explore a new direction that avoids over-reliance on LLM teachers, introducing a multi-view fine-tuning method that efficiently exploits existing mathematical problem datasets with diverse annotation styles. Our approach uniquely considers the various annotation formats as different ""views"" and leverages them in training the model. By postpending distinct instructions to input questions, models can learn to generate solutions in diverse formats in a flexible manner. Experimental results show that our strategy enables a LLaMA-7B model to outperform prior approaches that utilize knowledge distillation, as well as carefully established baselines. Additionally, the proposed method grants the models promising generalization ability across various views and datasets, and the capability to learn from inaccurate or incomplete noisy data. We hope our multi-view training paradigm could inspire future studies in other machine reasoning domains.

Research on image tokenizers has previously reached an impasse, as frameworks employing quantized visual tokens have lost prominence due to subpar performance and convergence in multimodal comprehension (compared to BLIP-2, etc.) or generation (compared to Stable Diffusion, etc.). Despite the limitations, we remain confident in its natural capacity to unify visual and textual representations, facilitating scalable multimodal training with LLM's original recipe. In this study, we identify two crucial principles for the architecture and training of SEED that effectively ease subsequent alignment with LLMs. (1) Image tokens should be independent of 2D physical patch positions and instead be produced with a 1D causal dependency, exhibiting intrinsic interdependence that aligns with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. (2) Image tokens should capture high-level semantics consistent with the degree of semantic abstraction in words, and be optimized for both discriminativeness and reconstruction during the tokenizer training phase. As a result, the off-the-shelf LLM is able to perform both image-to-text and text-to-image generation by incorporating our SEED through efficient LoRA tuning. Comprehensive multimodal pretraining and instruction tuning, which may yield improved results, are reserved for future investigation. This version of SEED was trained in 5.7 days using only 64 V100 GPUs and 5M publicly available image-text pairs. Our preliminary study emphasizes the great potential of discrete visual tokens in versatile multimodal LLMs and the importance of proper image tokenizers in broader research.

To overcome this issue, quantization methods have been widely applied to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs as well as increasing the inference rate. However, a major challenge is that low-bit quantization methods often lead to performance degradation. It is important to understand how quantization impacts the capacity of LLMs. Different from previous studies focused on overall performance, this work aims to investigate the impact of quantization on \emph{emergent abilities}, which are important characteristics that distinguish LLMs from small language models. Specially, we examine the abilities of in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and instruction-following in quantized LLMs. Our empirical experiments show that these emergent abilities still exist in 4-bit quantization models, while 2-bit models encounter severe performance degradation on the test of these abilities. To improve the performance of low-bit models, we conduct two special experiments: (1) fine-gained impact analysis that studies which components (or substructures) are more sensitive to quantization, and (2) performance compensation through model fine-tuning. Our work derives a series of important findings to understand the impact of quantization on emergent abilities, and sheds lights on the possibilities of extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sun, 16 Jul 2023 15:11:01 GMT'}, {'version': 'v2', 'created': 'Wed, 26 Jul 2023 04:15:48 GMT'}]",2023-07-27,"[['Liu', 'Peiyu', ''], ['Liu', 'Zikang', ''], ['Gao', 'Ze-Feng', ''], ['Gao', 'Dawei', ''], ['Zhao', 'Wayne Xin', ''], ['Li', 'Yaliang', ''], ['Ding', 'Bolin', ''], ['Wen', 'Ji-Rong', '']]",0,0,2023-07-16,2,8,2,0,0,0,c48fc69b62c749e78928d6a3bae98ffe278f761a,259937594.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c48fc69b62c749e78928d6a3bae98ffe278f761a,arXiv.org,2023.0,24.0,5.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2108129670', 'name': 'Peiyu Liu'}, {'authorId': '2119618242', 'name': 'Zikang Liu'}, {'authorId': '9136116', 'name': 'Ze-Feng Gao'}, {'authorId': '2162036220', 'name': 'Dawei Gao'}, {'authorId': '2542603', 'name': 'Wayne Xin Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2110479359', 'name': 'Yaliang Li'}, {'authorId': '1696332', 'name': 'Bolin Ding'}, {'authorId': '153693432', 'name': 'Ji-rong Wen'}]","['Beijing Key Laboratory of Big', 'Renmin University of China']",['China'],2023-07

To bridge the gap, we propose Disco-Bench, a benchmark that can evaluate intra-sentence discourse properties across a diverse set of NLP tasks, covering understanding, translation, and generation. Disco-Bench consists of 9 document-level testsets in the literature domain, which contain rich discourse phenomena (e.g. cohesion and coherence) in Chinese and/or English. For linguistic analysis, we also design a diagnostic test suite that can examine whether the target models learn discourse knowledge. We totally evaluate 20 general-, in-domain and commercial models based on Transformer, advanced pretraining architectures and large language models (LLMs).

However, none have assessed its performance using a large-scale real-world electronic health record database, nor have evaluated its utility in providing clinical diagnostic assistance for patients across a full range of disease presentation. We performed two analyses using ChatGPT and GPT-4, one to identify patients with specific medical diagnoses using a real-world large electronic health record database and the other, in providing diagnostic assistance to healthcare workers in the prospective evaluation of hypothetical patients. Our results show that GPT-4 across disease classification tasks with chain of thought and few-shot prompting can achieve performance as high as 96% F1 scores. For patient assessment, GPT-4 can accurately diagnose three out of four times. However, there were mentions of factually incorrect statements, overlooking crucial medical findings, recommendations for unnecessary investigations and overtreatment. These issues coupled with privacy concerns, make these models currently inadequate for real world clinical use. However, limited data and time needed for prompt engineering in comparison to configuration of conventional machine learning workflows highlight their potential for scalability across healthcare applications.

In this paper, we propose legal syllogism prompting (LoT), a simple prompting method to teach large language models (LLMs) for legal judgment prediction. LoT teaches only that in the legal syllogism the major premise is law, the minor premise is the fact, and the conclusion is judgment. Then the models can produce a syllogism reasoning of the case and give the judgment without any learning, fine-tuning, or examples. On CAIL2018, a Chinese criminal case dataset, we performed zero-shot judgment prediction experiments with GPT-3 models. Our results show that LLMs with LoT achieve better performance than the baseline and chain of thought prompting, the state-of-art prompting method on diverse reasoning tasks. LoT enables the model to concentrate on the key information relevant to the judgment and to correctly understand the legal meaning of acts, as compared to other methods. Our method enables LLMs to predict judgment along with law articles and justification, which significantly enhances the explainability of models.

  https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/latent-jailbreak",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Considerable research efforts have been devoted to ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values and generate safe text. However, an excessive focus on sensitivity to certain topics can compromise the model's robustness in following instructions, thereby impacting its overall performance in completing tasks. Previous benchmarks for jailbreaking LLMs have primarily focused on evaluating the safety of the models without considering their robustness. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that assesses both the safety and robustness of LLMs, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach. To comprehensively study text safety and output robustness, we introduce a latent jailbreak prompt dataset, each involving malicious instruction embedding. Specifically, we instruct the model to complete a regular task, such as translation, with the text to be translated containing malicious instructions. To further analyze safety and robustness, we design a hierarchical annotation framework. We present a systematic analysis of the safety and robustness of LLMs regarding the position of explicit normal instructions, word replacements (verbs in explicit normal instructions, target groups in malicious instructions, cue words for explicit normal instructions), and instruction replacements (different explicit normal instructions). Our results demonstrate that current LLMs not only prioritize certain instruction verbs but also exhibit varying jailbreak rates for different instruction verbs in explicit normal instructions.

Current diagnosis relies on self-reports and assessment scales, which have reliability issues. Objective approaches are needed for diagnosing depression. Objective: Evaluate the potential of GPT technology in diagnosing depression. Assess its ability to simulate individuals with depression and investigate the influence of depression scales. Methods: Three depression-related assessment tools (HAMD-17, SDS, GDS-15) were used. Two experiments simulated GPT responses to normal individuals and individuals with depression. Compare GPT's responses with expected results, assess its understanding of depressive symptoms, and performance differences under different conditions. Results: GPT's performance in depression assessment was evaluated. It aligned with scoring criteria for both individuals with depression and normal individuals. Some performance differences were observed based on depression severity. GPT performed better on scales with higher sensitivity. Conclusion: GPT accurately simulates individuals with depression and normal individuals during depression-related assessments. Deviations occur when simulating different degrees of depression, limiting understanding of mild and moderate cases. GPT performs better on scales with higher sensitivity, indicating potential for developing more effective depression scales. GPT has important potential in depression assessment, supporting clinicians and patients.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code will be available at https://aka.ms/retnet.

We propose the concept of federated LLM, which comprises three key components, i.e., federated LLM pre-training, federated LLM fine-tuning, and federated LLM prompt engineering. For each component, we discuss its advantage over traditional LLM training methods and propose specific engineering strategies for implementation. Furthermore, we explore the novel challenges introduced by the integration of FL and LLM.

While marveling at ChatGPT's incredible performance on kinds of tasks, we notice that ChatGPT also has excellent multilingual processing capabilities, such as Chinese. To explore the Chinese processing ability of ChatGPT, we focus on Chinese Text Correction, a fundamental and challenging Chinese NLP task. Specifically, we evaluate ChatGPT on the Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) and Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) tasks, which are two main Chinese Text Correction scenarios. From extensive analyses and comparisons with previous state-of-the-art fine-tuned models, we empirically find that the ChatGPT currently has both amazing performance and unsatisfactory behavior for Chinese Text Correction.

The model utilizes autoregressive neural networks, specifically Transformers, to learn the joint probability of logical operators and syndromes. This training is in an unsupervised way, without the need for labeled training data, and is thus referred to as pre-training. After the pre-training, the model can efficiently compute the likelihood of logical operators for any given syndrome, using maximum likelihood decoding. It can directly generate the most-likely logical operators with computational complexity $\mathcal O(2k)$ in the number of logical qubits $k$, which is significantly better than the conventional maximum likelihood decoding algorithms that require $\mathcal O(4^k)$ computation. Based on the pre-trained model, we further propose refinement to achieve more accurately the likelihood of logical operators for a given syndrome by directly sampling the stabilizer operators. We perform numerical experiments on stabilizer codes with small code distances, using both depolarizing error models and error models with correlated noise. The results show that our approach provides significantly better decoding accuracy than the minimum weight perfect matching and belief-propagation-based algorithms. Our framework is general and can be applied to any error model and quantum codes with different topologies such as surface codes and quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, it leverages the parallelization capabilities of GPUs, enabling simultaneous decoding of a large number of syndromes. Our approach sheds light on the efficient and accurate decoding of quantum error-correcting codes using generative artificial intelligence and modern computational power.

However, their alignment with human emotions and values, which is critical for real-world applications, has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we assessed LLMs' Emotional Intelligence (EI), encompassing emotion recognition, interpretation, and understanding, which is necessary for effective communication and social interactions. Specifically, we first developed a novel psychometric assessment focusing on Emotion Understanding (EU), a core component of EI, suitable for both humans and LLMs. This test requires evaluating complex emotions (e.g., surprised, joyful, puzzled, proud) in realistic scenarios (e.g., despite feeling underperformed, John surprisingly achieved a top score). With a reference frame constructed from over 500 adults, we tested a variety of mainstream LLMs. Most achieved above-average EQ scores, with GPT-4 exceeding 89% of human participants with an EQ of 117. Interestingly, a multivariate pattern analysis revealed that some LLMs apparently did not reply on the human-like mechanism to achieve human-level performance, as their representational patterns were qualitatively distinct from humans. In addition, we discussed the impact of factors such as model size, training method, and architecture on LLMs' EQ. In summary, our study presents one of the first psychometric evaluations of the human-like characteristics of LLMs, which may shed light on the future development of LLMs aiming for both high intellectual and emotional intelligence.

Lyu",Generative Type Inference for Python,This paper has been accepted by ASE'23,,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Python is a popular dynamic programming language, evidenced by its ranking as the second most commonly used language on GitHub. However, its dynamic type system can lead to potential type errors, leading researchers to explore automatic type inference approaches for Python programs. The rule-based type inference approaches can ensure the accuracy of predicted variable types, but they suffer from low coverage problems. Supervised type inference approaches, while feature-agnostic, require large, high-quality annotated datasets and are limited to pre-defined types. As zero-shot approaches, the cloze-style approaches reformulate the type inference problem into a fill-in-the-blank problem. However, their performance is limited.   This paper introduces TypeGen, a few-shot generative type inference approach that incorporates static domain knowledge from static analysis. TypeGen creates chain-of-thought (COT) prompts by translating the type inference steps of static analysis into prompts based on the type dependency graphs (TDGs), enabling language models to learn from how static analysis infers types. By combining COT prompts with code slices and type hints, TypeGen constructs example prompts from human annotations. TypeGen only requires very few annotated examples to teach language models to generate similar COT prompts via in-context learning. Moreover, TypeGen enhances the interpretability of results through the use of the input-explanation-output strategy. Experiments show that TypeGen outperforms the best baseline Type4Py by 10.0% for argument type prediction and 22.5% in return value type prediction in terms of top-1 Exact Match by using only five examples. Furthermore, TypeGen achieves substantial improvements of 27% to 84% compared to the zero-shot performance of large language models with parameter sizes ranging from 1.3B to 175B in terms of top-1 Exact Match.

However, existing end-to-end MLLMs only allow users to interact with them through language instructions, leading to the limitation of the interactive accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we present precise referring instructions that utilize diverse reference representations such as points and boxes as referring prompts to refer to the special region. This enables MLLMs to focus on the region of interest and achieve finer-grained interaction. Based on precise referring instruction, we propose ChatSpot, a unified end-to-end multimodal large language model that supports diverse forms of interactivity including mouse clicks, drag-and-drop, and drawing boxes, which provides a more flexible and seamless interactive experience. We also construct a multi-grained vision-language instruction-following dataset based on existing datasets and GPT-4 generating. Furthermore, we design a series of evaluation tasks to assess the effectiveness of region recognition and interaction. Experimental results showcase ChatSpot's promising performance.

Therefore, evaluation of human values alignment is becoming increasingly important. Previous work mainly focuses on assessing the performance of LLMs on certain knowledge and reasoning abilities, while neglecting the alignment to human values, especially in a Chinese context. In this paper, we present CValues, the first Chinese human values evaluation benchmark to measure the alignment ability of LLMs in terms of both safety and responsibility criteria. As a result, we have manually collected adversarial safety prompts across 10 scenarios and induced responsibility prompts from 8 domains by professional experts. To provide a comprehensive values evaluation of Chinese LLMs, we not only conduct human evaluation for reliable comparison, but also construct multi-choice prompts for automatic evaluation. Our findings suggest that while most Chinese LLMs perform well in terms of safety, there is considerable room for improvement in terms of responsibility. Moreover, both the automatic and human evaluation are important for assessing the human values alignment in different aspects. The benchmark and code is available on ModelScope and Github.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, generation, and knowledge inference, opening up exciting avenues for IR research. LLMs not only facilitate generative retrieval but also offer improved solutions for user understanding, model evaluation, and user-system interactions. More importantly, the synergistic relationship among IR models, LLMs, and humans forms a new technical paradigm that is more powerful for information seeking. IR models provide real-time and relevant information, LLMs contribute internal knowledge, and humans play a central role of demanders and evaluators to the reliability of information services. Nevertheless, significant challenges exist, including computational costs, credibility concerns, domain-specific limitations, and ethical considerations. To thoroughly discuss the transformative impact of LLMs on IR research, the Chinese IR community conducted a strategic workshop in April 2023, yielding valuable insights. This paper provides a summary of the workshop's outcomes, including the rethinking of IR's core values, the mutual enhancement of LLMs and IR, the proposal of a novel IR technical paradigm, and open challenges.

Researchers have begun exploring the implementation of LLMs as the driving core of social bots, enabling more efficient and user-friendly completion of tasks like profile completion, social behavior decision-making, and social content generation. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on the behavioral characteristics of LLMs-driven social bots and their impact on social networks. We have curated data from Chirper, a Twitter-like social network populated by LLMs-driven social bots and embarked on an exploratory study. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs-driven social bots possess enhanced individual-level camouflage while exhibiting certain collective characteristics; (2) these bots have the ability to exert influence on online communities through toxic behaviors; (3) existing detection methods are applicable to the activity environment of LLMs-driven social bots but may be subject to certain limitations in effectiveness. Moreover, we have organized the data collected in our study into the Masquerade-23 dataset, which we have publicly released, thus addressing the data void in the subfield of LLMs-driven social bots behavior datasets.

We propose IvyGPT, an LLM based on LLaMA that is trained and fine-tuned with high-quality medical question-answer (QA) instances and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). After supervised fine-tuning, IvyGPT has good multi-turn conversation capabilities, but it cannot perform like a doctor in other aspects, such as comprehensive diagnosis. Through RLHF, IvyGPT can output richer diagnosis and treatment answers that are closer to human.

A blockchain is a secure, decentralized, and transparent system that allows for the creation of a tamper-proof ledger for transactions without the need for intermediaries.

While existing job recommendation methods encounter challenges such as the low quality of users' resumes, which hampers their accuracy and practical effectiveness. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), utilizing the rich external knowledge encapsulated within them, as well as their powerful capabilities of text processing and reasoning, is a promising way to complete users' resumes for more accurate recommendations. However, directly leveraging LLMs to enhance recommendation results is not a one-size-fits-all solution, as LLMs may suffer from fabricated generation and few-shot problems, which degrade the quality of resume completion. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-based approach for job recommendation. To alleviate the limitation of fabricated generation for LLMs, we extract accurate and valuable information beyond users' self-description, which helps the LLMs better profile users for resume completion. Specifically, we not only extract users' explicit properties (e.g., skills, interests) from their self-description but also infer users' implicit characteristics from their behaviors for more accurate and meaningful resume completion. Nevertheless, some users still suffer from few-shot problems, which arise due to scarce interaction records, leading to limited guidance for the models in generating high-quality resumes. To address this issue, we propose aligning unpaired low-quality with high-quality generated resumes by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can refine the resume representations for better recommendation results. Extensive experiments on three large real-world recruitment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The preferred collaborative role and initiative of LLMs during such a creativity process is also unclear. To investigate human-LLM collaboration patterns and dynamics during prewriting, we conducted a three-session qualitative study with 15 participants in two creative tasks: story writing and slogan writing. The findings indicated that during collaborative prewriting, there appears to be a three-stage iterative Human-AI Co-creativity process that includes Ideation, Illumination, and Implementation stages. This collaborative process champions the human in a dominant role, in addition to mixed and shifting levels of initiative that exist between humans and LLMs. This research also reports on collaboration breakdowns that occur during this process, user perceptions of using existing LLMs during Human-AI Co-creativity, and discusses design implications to support this co-creativity process.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT), have demonstrated impressive prowess in solving a wide range of tasks with world knowledge, including knowledge-intensive tasks. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs are able to perceive their factual knowledge boundaries, particularly how they behave when incorporating retrieval augmentation. In this study, we present an initial analysis of the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation affects LLMs on open-domain QA. Specially, we focus on three primary research questions and analyze them by examining QA performance, priori judgement and posteriori judgement of LLMs. We show evidence that LLMs possess unwavering confidence in their capabilities to respond to questions and the accuracy of their responses. Furthermore, retrieval augmentation proves to be an effective approach in enhancing LLMs' awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby improving their judgemental abilities. Additionally, we also find that LLMs have a propensity to rely on the provided retrieval results when formulating answers, while the quality of these results significantly impacts their reliance.

However, these interactions still face limitations in complexity and flexibility, particularly in scenarios involving multiple characters and novel objects. Pre-defining all interactable objects in the agent's world model presents challenges, and conveying implicit intentions to multiple characters through complex interactions remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose integrating virtual Game Masters (GMs) into the agent's world model, drawing inspiration from Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). GMs play a crucial role in overseeing information, estimating players' intentions, providing environment descriptions, and offering feedback, compensating for current world model deficiencies. To facilitate future explorations for complex interactions, we introduce a benchmark named Tachikuma, comprising a Multiple character and novel Object based interaction Estimation (MOE) task and a supporting dataset. MOE challenges models to understand characters' intentions and accurately determine their actions within intricate contexts involving multi-character and novel object interactions. Besides, the dataset captures log data from real-time communications during gameplay, providing diverse, grounded, and complex interactions for further explorations. Finally, we present a simple prompting baseline and evaluate its performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interaction understanding. We hope that our dataset and task will inspire further research in complex interactions with natural language, fostering the development of more advanced AI agents.

The goal of this work is three folds. First, we analyze the correctness of ChatGPT on code generation tasks and uncover the factors that influence its effectiveness, including task difficulty, programming language, time that tasks are introduced, and program size. Second, we identify and characterize potential issues with the quality of ChatGPT-generated code. Last, we provide insights into how these issues can be mitigated. Experiments highlight that out of 4,066 programs generated by ChatGPT, 2,757 programs are deemed correct, 1,081 programs provide wrong outputs, and 177 programs contain compilation or runtime errors. Additionally, we further analyze other characteristics of the generated code through static analysis tools, such as code style and maintainability, and find that 1,933 ChatGPT-generated code snippets suffer from maintainability issues. Subsequently, we investigate ChatGPT's self-debugging ability and its interaction with static analysis tools to fix the errors uncovered in the previous step. Experiments suggest that ChatGPT can partially address these challenges, improving code quality by more than 20%, but there are still limitations and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the current limitations of ChatGPT and offers a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the code generation capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT.

The idea of linking several large language models together is inspired by the functionality of human brain. The specific regions on the brain cortex are specific for certain low level functionality. And these regions can jointly work together to achieve more complex high level functionality. Such behavior on human brain cortex sheds the light to design the multilevel large language models that contain global level, field level and user level models. The user level models run on local machines to achieve efficient response and protect the user's privacy.

Irrespective of these models' own capacity and structure, there is a growing demand for LLMs to possess enhanced comprehension of longer and more complex contexts with relatively smaller sizes. Models often encounter an upper limit when processing sequences of sentences that extend beyond their comprehension capacity and result in off-topic or even chaotic responses. While several recent works attempt to address this issue in various ways, they rarely focus on ""why models are unable to compensate or strengthen their capabilities on their own"". In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the nature of information transfer within LLMs and propose a novel technique called Attention Transition. This technique empowers models to achieve longer and better context comprehension with minimal additional training or impact on generation fluency. Our experiments are conducted on the challenging XSum dataset using LLaMa-7b model with context token length ranging from 800 to 1900.

To address this challenge, in this work we introduce ControlRetriever, a generic and efficient approach with a parameter isolated architecture, capable of controlling dense retrieval models to directly perform varied retrieval tasks, harnessing the power of instructions that explicitly describe retrieval intents in natural language. Leveraging the foundation of ControlNet, which has proven powerful in text-to-image generation, ControlRetriever imbues different retrieval models with the new capacity of controllable retrieval, all while being guided by task-specific instructions. Furthermore, we propose a novel LLM guided Instruction Synthesizing and Iterative Training strategy, which iteratively tunes ControlRetriever based on extensive automatically-generated retrieval data with diverse instructions by capitalizing the advancement of large language models. Extensive experiments show that in the BEIR benchmark, with only natural language descriptions of specific retrieval intent for each task, ControlRetriever, as a unified multi-task retrieval system without task-specific tuning, significantly outperforms baseline methods designed with task-specific retrievers and also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

GameEval treats LLMs as game players and assigns them distinct roles with specific goals achieved by launching conversations of various forms, including discussion, question answering, and voting. We design three unique games with cooperative or adversarial objectives, accompanied by corresponding evaluation metrics, to show how this new paradigm comprehensively evaluates model performance.Through extensive experiments, we show that GameEval can effectively differentiate the capabilities of various LLMs, providing a comprehensive assessment of their integrated abilities to solve complex problems.

However, the quality of different human-written prompts leads to substantial discrepancies in LLMs' performance, and improving prompts usually necessitates considerable human effort and expertise. To this end, this paper proposes Prompt with Actor-Critic Editing (PACE) for LLMs to enable automatic prompt editing. Drawing inspiration from the actor-critic algorithm in reinforcement learning, PACE leverages LLMs as the dual roles of actors and critics, conceptualizing prompt as a type of policy. PACE refines prompt, taking into account the feedback from both actors performing prompt and critics criticizing response. This process helps LLMs better align prompt to a specific task, thanks to real responses and thinking from LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 instruction induction tasks and 21 big-bench tasks. Experimental results indicate that PACE elevates the relative performance of medium/low-quality human-written prompts by up to 98\%, which has comparable performance to high-quality human-written prompts. Moreover, PACE also exhibits notable efficacy for prompt generation.

The REVERIE (Remote Embodied Referring Expression) is interesting since it only provides high-level instructions to the agent, which are closer to human commands in practice. Nevertheless, this poses more challenges than other VLN tasks since it requires agents to infer a navigation plan only based on a short instruction. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in robot action planning by providing proper prompts. Still, this strategy has not been explored under the REVERIE settings. There are several new challenges. For example, the LLM should be environment-aware so that the navigation plan can be adjusted based on the current visual observation. Moreover, the LLM planned actions should be adaptable to the much larger and more complex REVERIE environment. This paper proposes a March-in-Chat (MiC) model that can talk to the LLM on the fly and plan dynamically based on a newly proposed Room-and-Object Aware Scene Perceiver (ROASP). Our MiC model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by large margins by SPL and RGSPL metrics on the REVERIE benchmark.

Moreover, state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 and Claude are primarily accessible through API calls, with their parametric weights remaining proprietary and unavailable to the public. This scenario emphasizes the growing need for new methodologies that allow learning from agent experiences without requiring parametric updates. To address these problems, we introduce the Experiential Learning (ExpeL) agent. Our agent autonomously gathers experiences and extracts knowledge using natural language from a collection of training tasks. At inference, the agent recalls its extracted insights and past experiences to make informed decisions. Our empirical results highlight the robust learning efficacy of the ExpeL agent, indicating a consistent enhancement in its performance as it accumulates experiences. We further explore the emerging capabilities and transfer learning potential of the ExpeL agent through qualitative observations and additional experiments.

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model. It is worth mentioning that this paper is a technical report of our pre-release version, and we will report our specific experimental data in future versions.

Currently, the predominantly employed frameworks lack modular design, it often takes a lot of coding work to kickstart the training of LLM. To address this, we present ""LMTuner"", a highly usable, integrable, and scalable system for training LLMs expeditiously and with minimal user-input. LMTuner comprises three main modules - the Interaction, Training, and Inference Modules. We advocate that LMTuner's usability and integrality alleviate the complexities in training large language models. Remarkably, even a novice user could commence training large language models within five minutes. Furthermore, it integrates DeepSpeed frameworks and supports Efficient Fine-Tuning methodologies like Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Quantized LoRA (QLoRA), etc., enabling the training of language models scaling from 300M to a whopping 130B parameters using a single server.

A primary research objective of such models is to align visual and textual modalities effectively while comprehending human instructions. Current methodologies often rely on annotations derived from benchmark datasets to construct image-dialogue datasets for training purposes, akin to instruction tuning in LLMs. However, these datasets often exhibit domain bias, potentially constraining the generative capabilities of the models. In an effort to mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data collection methodology that synchronously synthesizes images and dialogues for visual instruction tuning. This approach harnesses the power of generative models, marrying the abilities of ChatGPT and text-to-image generative models to yield a diverse and controllable dataset with varied image content. This not only provides greater flexibility compared to existing methodologies but also significantly enhances several model capabilities.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift within the ML community, showcasing their exceptional capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks. While existing research has probed OOD detection with relative small-scale Transformers like BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2, the stark differences in scales, pre-training objectives, and inference paradigms call into question the applicability of these findings to LLMs. This paper embarks on a pioneering empirical investigation of OOD detection in the domain of LLMs, focusing on LLaMA series ranging from 7B to 65B in size. We thoroughly evaluate commonly-used OOD detectors, scrutinizing their performance in both zero-grad and fine-tuning scenarios. Notably, we alter previous discriminative in-distribution fine-tuning into generative fine-tuning, aligning the pre-training objective of LLMs with downstream tasks. Our findings unveil that a simple cosine distance OOD detector demonstrates superior efficacy, outperforming other OOD detectors. We provide an intriguing explanation for this phenomenon by highlighting the isotropic nature of the embedding spaces of LLMs, which distinctly contrasts with the anisotropic property observed in smaller BERT family models. The new insight enhances our understanding of how LLMs detect OOD data, thereby enhancing their adaptability and reliability in dynamic environments.

Zero-shot CoT prompting is one of the most common methods in CoT prompting. However, in the LTGM task, Zero-shot CoT prompting can not simulate a counselor or provide personalized strategies without effective mental health counseling strategy prompts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a zero-shot Dynamic Strategy Chain (DSC) prompting method. Firstly, we utilize GPT2 to learn the responses written by mental health counselors and dynamically generate mental health counseling strategies tailored to the help-seekers' needs. Secondly, the Zero-shot DSC prompting is constructed according to mental health counseling strategies and the help-seekers' post. Finally, the Zero-shot DSC prompting is employed to guide LLMs in generating more human-like responses for the help-seekers. Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that Zero-shot DSC prompting can deliver more human-like responses than CoT prompting methods on LTGM tasks.

The tuning recipe substantially deviates from the common contrastive vision-language learning. However, the performance of GVLMs in multimodal compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored, as existing evaluation metrics and benchmarks focus predominantly on assessing contrastive models like CLIP. In this paper, we examine the potential evaluation metrics to assess the GVLMs and hypothesize generative score methods are suitable for evaluating compositionality. In addition, current benchmarks tend to prioritize syntactic correctness over semantics. The presence of morphological bias in these benchmarks can be exploited by GVLMs, leading to ineffective evaluations. To combat this, we define a MorphoBias Score to quantify the morphological bias and propose a novel LLM-based strategy to calibrate the bias. Moreover, a challenging task is added to evaluate the robustness of GVLMs against inherent inclination toward syntactic correctness. We include the calibrated dataset and the task into a new benchmark, namely MOrphologicall De-biased Benchmark (MODE). Our study provides the first unbiased benchmark for the compositionality of GVLMs, facilitating future research in this direction. We will release our code and datasets.

The expensive computation and memory costs make it difficult to train them on limited hardware resources, especially for recent popular large language models (LLM) and computer vision models (CV). Recent popular dataset distillation methods are thus developed, aiming to reduce the number of training samples via synthesizing small-scale datasets via gradient matching. However, as the gradient calculation is coupled with the specific network architecture, the synthesized dataset is biased and performs poorly when used for training unseen architectures. To address these limitations, we present dataset quantization (DQ), a new framework to compress large-scale datasets into small subsets which can be used for training any neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DQ is able to generate condensed small datasets for training unseen network architectures with state-of-the-art compression ratios for lossless model training. To the best of our knowledge, DQ is the first method that can successfully distill large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1k with a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, with 60% data from ImageNet and 20% data from Alpaca's instruction tuning data, the models can be trained with negligible or no performance drop for both vision tasks (including classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) as well as language tasks (including instruction tuning tasks such as BBH and DROP).

However, LLMs are sometimes too footloose for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks which always have restricted output and input format. Their performances on NLU tasks are highly related to prompts or demonstrations and are shown to be poor at performing several representative NLU tasks, such as event extraction and entity typing. To this end, we present SeqGPT, a bilingual (i.e., English and Chinese) open-source autoregressive model specially enhanced for open-domain natural language understanding. We express all NLU tasks with two atomic tasks, which define fixed instructions to restrict the input and output format but still ``open'' for arbitrarily varied label sets. The model is first instruction-tuned with extremely fine-grained labeled data synthesized by ChatGPT and then further fine-tuned by 233 different atomic tasks from 152 datasets across various domains. The experimental results show that SeqGPT has decent classification and extraction ability, and is capable of performing language understanding tasks on unseen domains.

Most current methods first generate the Intermediate Meaning Representations (IMRs) of questions and then generate answers. Current SOTA methods generate programs as IMRs with large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, equations have fewer restrictions and closer semantics to the question than programs, leading to higher generation accuracy. However, current LLMs generate equations worse than programs, where we assume that the equation data is rare in pre-training data compared to programs. So in this paper, we try to use equations as IMRs to solve the numerical reasoning task by addressing two problems: (1) Theoretically, how to prove that the equation is an IMR with higher generation accuracy than programs; (2) Empirically, how to improve the generation accuracy of equations with LLMs. For the first problem, we propose and prove a proposition to theoretically compare the generation accuracy of different IMRs. For the second problem, we present a method called Boosting Numerical Reason\textbfing by Decomposing the Generation of Equations (Bridge), which can improve the accuracy of LLMs in generating equations as IMRs by reducing the tendency of generating constant expressions and programs.

Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment. In view of these behaviors, we discuss some possible strategies to leverage positive ones and mitigate negative ones for improving the collaborative potential of multi-agent groups.

In our benchmark, we challenge LLMs with 2 aspects: the quality of questions posed by the model and the model's capability to integrate information for problem-solving. We find that nearly all LLMs struggle with employing lateral thinking during interactions. For example, even the most advanced model, GPT-4, exhibits the advantage to some extent, yet still maintain a noticeable gap when compared to human.

In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world public dataset (i.e., MovieLens-1M) to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension.

  Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2023)",,,,cs.SE cs.CL cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The automation of code review activities, a long-standing pursuit in software engineering, has been primarily addressed by numerous domain-specific pre-trained models. Despite their success, these models frequently demand extensive resources for pre-training from scratch. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an intriguing alternative, given their remarkable capabilities when supplemented with domain-specific knowledge. However, their potential for automating code review tasks remains largely unexplored.   In response to this research gap, we present LLaMA-Reviewer, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLaMA, a popular LLM, in the realm of code review. Mindful of resource constraints, this framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, delivering high performance while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.   An extensive evaluation of LLaMA-Reviewer is conducted on two diverse, publicly available datasets. Notably, even with the smallest LLaMA base model consisting of 6.7B parameters and a limited number of tuning epochs, LLaMA-Reviewer equals the performance of existing code-review-focused models.   The ablation experiments provide insights into the influence of various fine-tuning process components, including input representation, instruction tuning, and different PEFT methods. To foster continuous progress in this field, the code and all PEFT-weight plugins have been made open-source.

Current methods for developing cooperative agents predominantly rely on learning-based methods, where policy generalization heavily hinges on past interactions with specific teammates. These approaches constrain the agent's capacity to recalibrate its strategy when confronted with novel teammates. We propose \textbf{ProAgent}, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to fashion a \textit{pro}active \textit{agent} empowered with the ability to anticipate teammates' forthcoming decisions and formulate enhanced plans for itself. ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt its behavior to enhance collaborative efforts with teammates. Moreover, the ProAgent framework exhibits a high degree of modularity and interpretability, facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of \textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent, outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models, its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10\% compared to the current state-of-the-art, COLE.

Derivative products, like ChatGPT, have been extensively deployed and highly sought after. Meanwhile, the evaluation and optimization of LLMs in software engineering tasks, such as code generation, have become a research focus. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the application and evaluation of LLMs in the field of software engineering. Therefore, this paper is the first to comprehensively investigate and collate the research and products combining LLMs with software engineering, aiming to answer two questions: (1) What are the current integrations of LLMs with software engineering? (2) Can LLMs effectively handle software engineering tasks?

Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

  overturning of the overall conclusions of the paper",,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have emerged with astonishing capabilities approaching artificial general intelligence. While providing convenience for various societal needs, LLMs have also lowered the cost of generating harmful content. Consequently, LLM developers have deployed semantic-level defenses to recognize and reject prompts that may lead to inappropriate content. Unfortunately, these defenses are not foolproof, and some attackers have crafted ""jailbreak"" prompts that temporarily hypnotize the LLM into forgetting content defense rules and answering any improper questions. To date, there is no clear explanation of the principles behind these semantic-level attacks and defenses in both industry and academia.   This paper investigates the LLM jailbreak problem and proposes an automatic jailbreak method for the first time. We propose the concept of a semantic firewall and provide three technical implementation approaches. Inspired by the attack that penetrates traditional firewalls through reverse tunnels, we introduce a ""self-deception"" attack that can bypass the semantic firewall by inducing LLM to generate prompts that facilitate jailbreak. We generated a total of 2,520 attack payloads in six languages (English, Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic) across seven virtual scenarios, targeting the three most common types of violations: violence, hate, and pornography. The experiment was conducted on two models, namely the GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. The success rates on the two models were 86.2% and 67%, while the failure rates were 4.7% and 2.2%, respectively. This highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed attack method. All experimental code and raw data will be released as open-source to inspire future research. We believe that manipulating AI behavior through carefully crafted prompts will become an important research direction in the future.

For better cross-modal grounding abilities of the drone agent, we propose a Target-Grounded Graph-Aware Transformer (TG-GAT) framework. Concretely, TG-GAT first leverages a graph-aware transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependency, which benefits navigation state tracking and robust action planning. In addition,an auxiliary visual grounding task is devised to boost the agent's awareness of referred landmarks. Moreover, a hybrid augmentation strategy based on large language models is utilized to mitigate data scarcity limitations.

  Schuller",Refashioning Emotion Recognition Modelling: The Advent of Generalised Large Models,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  After the inception of emotion recognition or affective computing, it has increasingly become an active research topic due to its broad applications. Over the past couple of decades, emotion recognition models have gradually migrated from statistically shallow models to neural network-based deep models, which can significantly boost the performance of emotion recognition models and consistently achieve the best results on different benchmarks. Therefore, in recent years, deep models have always been considered the first option for emotion recognition. However, the debut of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has remarkably astonished the world due to their emerged capabilities of zero/few-shot learning, in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and others that are never shown in previous deep models. In the present paper, we comprehensively investigate how the LLMs perform in emotion recognition in terms of diverse aspects, including in-context learning, few-short learning, accuracy, generalisation, and explanation. Moreover, we offer some insights and pose other potential challenges, hoping to ignite broader discussions about enhancing emotion recognition in the new era of advanced and generalised large models.

We introduce an innovative methodology that synthesizes human insights with the computational prowess of LLMs to curate an extensive emotional support dialogue dataset. Our approach is initiated with a meticulously designed set of dialogues spanning diverse scenarios as generative seeds. By utilizing the in-context learning potential of ChatGPT, we recursively generate an ExTensible Emotional Support dialogue dataset, named ExTES. Following this, we deploy advanced tuning techniques on the LLaMA model, examining the impact of diverse training strategies, ultimately yielding an LLM meticulously optimized for emotional support interactions. An exhaustive assessment of the resultant model showcases its proficiency in offering emotional support, marking a pivotal step in the realm of emotional support bots and paving the way for subsequent research and implementations.

Since the magnitude of available labeled electroencephalogram (EEG) data is much lower than that of text and image data, it is difficult for transformer models pre-trained from EEG to be developed as large as GPT-4 100T to fully unleash the potential of this architecture. In this paper, we show that transformers pre-trained from images as well as text can be directly fine-tuned for EEG-based prediction tasks. We design AdaCE, plug-and-play Adapters for Converting EEG data into image as well as text forms, to fine-tune pre-trained vision and language transformers. The proposed AdaCE module is highly effective for fine-tuning pre-trained transformers while achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse EEG-based prediction tasks. For example, AdaCE on the pre-trained Swin-Transformer achieves 99.6%, an absolute improvement of 9.2%, on the EEG-decoding task of human activity recognition (UCI HAR). Furthermore, we empirically show that applying the proposed AdaCE to fine-tune larger pre-trained models can achieve better performance on EEG-based predicting tasks, indicating the potential of our adapters for even larger transformers. The plug-and-play AdaCE module can be applied to fine-tuning most of the popular pre-trained transformers on many other time-series data with multiple channels, not limited to EEG data and the models we use.

In this paper, we show how to distinguish ChatGPT-generated publications from counterparts produced by scientists. Using a newly designed supervised Machine Learning algorithm, we demonstrate how to detect machine-generated publications from those produced by scientists. The algorithm was trained using 100 real publication abstracts, followed by a 10-fold calibration approach to establish a lower-upper bound range of acceptance. In the comparison with ChatGPT content, it was evident that ChatGPT contributed merely 23\% of the bigram content, which is less than 50\% of any of the other 10 calibrating folds. This analysis highlights a significant disparity in technical terms where ChatGPT fell short of matching real science. When categorizing the individual articles, the xFakeBibs algorithm accurately identified 98 out of 100 publications as fake, with 2 articles incorrectly classified as real publications.

Existing methods primarily encourage LLMs to autonomously plan and solve problems or to extensively sample reasoning chains without addressing the conceptual and inferential fallacies. Attempting to alleviate inferential fallacies and drawing inspiration from multi-agent collaboration, we present a framework to increase faithfulness and causality for knowledge-based reasoning. Specifically, we propose to employ multiple intelligent agents (i.e., reasoners and an evaluator) to work collaboratively in a reasoning-and-consensus paradigm for elevated reasoning faithfulness. The reasoners focus on providing solutions with human-like causality to solve open-domain problems. On the other hand, the \textit{evaluator} agent scrutinizes if a solution is deducible from a non-causal perspective and if it still holds when challenged by a counterfactual candidate. According to the extensive and comprehensive evaluations on a variety of knowledge reasoning tasks (e.g., science question answering and commonsense reasoning), our framework outperforms all compared state-of-the-art approaches by large margins.

Traditional methods are usually difficult to grasp the complex semantic information in news texts, resulting in unsatisfactory recommendation results. Besides, these traditional methods are more friendly to active users with rich historical behaviors. However, they can not effectively solve the ""long tail problem"" of inactive users. To address these issues, this research presents a novel general framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into semantic representations of traditional methods. In order to improve semantic understanding in complex news texts, we use LLMs' powerful text understanding ability to generate news representations containing rich semantic information. In addition, our method combines the information about news entities and mines high-order structural information through multiple hops in KG, thus alleviating the challenge of long tail distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with various traditional models, the framework significantly improves the recommendation effect. The successful integration of LLM and KG in our framework has established a feasible path for achieving more accurate personalized recommendations in the news field.

Our key innovation, the Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD) metric, emerges as a pivotal tool to identify discrepancies between a model's expected responses and its autonomous generation prowess. Through the adept application of IFD, cherry samples are pinpointed, leading to a marked uptick in model training efficiency. Empirical validations on renowned datasets like Alpaca and WizardLM underpin our findings; with a mere 10% of conventional data input, our strategy showcases improved results.

To further improve the performance, prompt ensemble has attracted substantial interest for tackling the hallucination and instability of LLMs. However, existing methods usually adopt a two-stage paradigm, which requires a pre-prepared set of prompts with substantial manual effort, and is unable to perform directed optimization for different weak learners. In this paper, we propose a simple, universal, and automatic method named PREFER (Pompt Ensemble learning via Feedback-Reflect-Refine) to address the stated limitations. Specifically, given the fact that weak learners are supposed to focus on hard examples during boosting, PREFER builds a feedback mechanism for reflecting on the inadequacies of existing weak learners. Based on this, the LLM is required to automatically synthesize new prompts for iterative refinement. Moreover, to enhance stability of the prompt effect evaluation, we propose a novel prompt bagging method involving forward and backward thinking, which is superior to majority voting and is beneficial for both feedback and weight calculation in boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PREFER achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of tasks by a significant margin. We have made our code publicly available.

However, the success is typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a zero-shot manner for both image-to-text and text-to-image generation, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese.

In this paper, we introduce InstructionGPT-4, which is fine-tuned on a small dataset comprising only 200 examples, amounting to approximately 6% of the instruction-following data used in the alignment dataset for MiniGPT-4. We first propose several metrics to access the quality of multimodal instruction data. Based on these metrics, we present a simple and effective data selector to automatically identify and filter low-quality vision-language data. By employing this method, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 on various evaluations (e.g., visual question answering, GPT-4 preference).

Considering the locality modeled by the self-attention mechanism of LLMs, these models face the risk of instruction forgetting when generating responses for long input sentences. To mitigate this issue, we propose enhancing the instruction-following capability of LLMs by shifting the position of task instructions after the input sentences. Theoretical analysis suggests that our straightforward method can alter the model's learning focus, thereby emphasizing the training of instruction-following capabilities. Concurrently, experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional settings across various model scales (1B / 7B / 13B) and different sequence generation tasks (translation and summarization), without any additional data or annotation costs.

This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks.

However, the application of LLMs in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. To bridge this gap, we propose LLMRec, a LLM-based recommender system designed for benchmarking LLMs on various recommendation tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several popular off-the-shelf LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, ChatGLM, on five recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct recommendation, explanation generation, and review summarization. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of supervised finetuning to improve LLMs' instruction compliance ability. The benchmark results indicate that LLMs displayed only moderate proficiency in accuracy-based tasks such as sequential and direct recommendation. However, they demonstrated comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in explainability-based tasks. We also conduct qualitative evaluations to further evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models, and the results show that LLMs can truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results.

In this paper, we show that large language model training and optimization can be seen as a softmax regression problem. We then establish a method of efficiently performing softmax regression, in a way that prevents the regression function from generating copyright data.

However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment.

It posits that individuals' explicit social bias, which is their conscious expression of bias in the statements, may differ from their implicit social bias, which represents their unconscious bias. We propose a two-stage approach and discover a parallel phenomenon in LLMs known as ""re-judge inconsistency"" in social bias. In the initial stage, the LLM is tasked with automatically completing statements, potentially incorporating implicit social bias. However, in the subsequent stage, the same LLM re-judges the biased statement generated by itself but contradicts it. We propose that this re-judge inconsistency can be similar to the inconsistency between human's unaware implicit social bias and their aware explicit social bias. Experimental investigations on ChatGPT and GPT-4 concerning common gender biases examined in psychology corroborate the highly stable nature of the re-judge inconsistency. This finding may suggest that diverse cognitive constructs emerge as LLMs' capabilities strengthen. Consequently, leveraging psychological theories can provide enhanced insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the expressions of explicit and implicit constructs in LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 24 Aug 2023 05:35:58 GMT'}]",2023-08-25,"[['Zhao', 'Yachao', ''], ['Wang', 'Bo', ''], ['Zhao', 'Dongming', ''], ['Huang', 'Kun', ''], ['Wang', 'Yan', ''], ['He', 'Ruifang', ''], ['Hou', 'Yuexian', '']]",1,1,2023-08-24,1,7,2,2,0,2,5a839db23d769bef6fa224feda6bf17dd0688e8a,261101090.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5a839db23d769bef6fa224feda6bf17dd0688e8a,arXiv.org,2023.0,23.0,1.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Psychology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2233316526', 'name': 'Yachao Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2153213077', 'name': 'Bo Wang'}, {'authorId': '2163295226', 'name': 'Dongming Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2187583931', 'name': 'Kun Huang'}, {'authorId': '2152547812', 'name': 'Yan Wang'}, {'authorId': '1724097', 'name': 'Ruifang He'}, {'authorId': '1785922', 'name': 'Yuexian Hou'}]","['AI Lab, China Mobile Communication Group Tianjin Co., Ltd.', 'Tianjin University']",['China'],2023-08

  https://github.com/pppa2019/swie_overmiss_llm4mt",,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) present strong general capabilities, and a current compelling challenge is stimulating their specialized capabilities, such as machine translation, through low-cost instruction tuning. The standard instruction-following data is sequentially organized as the concatenation of an instruction, an input, and a response. As the attention mechanism of LLMs has limitations on local focus, LLMs tend to focus more on the words or sentences nearby at each position. This leads to a high risk of instruction forgetting during decoding. To alleviate the above issues, We propose SWIE (Segment-Weighted Instruction Embedding) and an instruction-following dataset OVERMISS. SWIE improves the model instruction understanding by adding a global instruction representation on the following input and response representations. OVERMISS improves model faithfulness by comparing over-translation and miss-translation results with the correct translation. We apply our methods to two main-stream open-source LLMs, BLOOM and LLaMA. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in translation performance with SWIE based on BLOOMZ-3b, particularly in zero-shot and long text translations due to reduced instruction forgetting risk. Additionally, OVERMISS outperforms the baseline in translation performance (e.g. an increase in BLEU scores from 0.69 to 3.12 and an average improvement of 0.48 percentage comet scores for LLaMA-7b) with further enhancements seen in models combining OVERMISS and SWIE (e.g. the BLUE scores increase up to 0.56 from English to German across three different backbones), and both exhibit improvements in the faithfulness metric based on word alignment.

However, these methods carry potential risks arising from the usage requirements of powerful closed-source models, which strictly forbid the utilization of their outputs to develop machine learning models. To deal with this problem, in this work, we explore alternative approaches to generate high-quality instruction data that do not rely on closed-source models. Our exploration includes an investigation of various existing instruction generation methods, culminating in the integration of the most efficient variant with two novel strategies to enhance the quality further. Evaluation results from two benchmarks and the GPT-4 model demonstrate the effectiveness of our generated instruction data, which can outperform Alpaca, a method reliant on closed-source models.

However, the scarcity of high-quality instruction-tuning data for vision-language tasks remains a challenge. The current leading paradigm, such as LLaVA, relies on language-only GPT-4 to generate data, which requires pre-annotated image captions and detection bounding boxes, suffering from understanding image details. A practical solution to this problem would be to utilize the available multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate instruction data for vision-language tasks. However, it's worth noting that the currently accessible MLLMs are not as powerful as their LLM counterparts, as they tend to produce inadequate responses and generate false information. As a solution for addressing the current issue, this paper proposes the Visual Instruction Generation and Correction (VIGC) framework that enables multimodal large language models to generate instruction-tuning data and progressively enhance its quality on-the-fly. Specifically, Visual Instruction Generation (VIG) guides the vision-language model to generate diverse instruction-tuning data. To ensure generation quality, Visual Instruction Correction (VIC) adopts an iterative update mechanism to correct any inaccuracies in data produced by VIG, effectively reducing the risk of hallucination. Leveraging the diverse, high-quality data generated by VIGC, we finetune mainstream models and validate data quality based on various evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that VIGC not only compensates for the shortcomings of language-only data generation methods, but also effectively enhances the benchmark performance.

Audio processing, with its diverse signal representations and a wide range of sources--from human voices to musical instruments and environmental sounds--poses challenges distinct from those found in traditional Natural Language Processing scenarios. Nevertheless, \textit{Large Audio Models}, epitomized by transformer-based architectures, have shown marked efficacy in this sphere. By leveraging massive amount of data, these models have demonstrated prowess in a variety of audio tasks, spanning from Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech to Music Generation, among others. Notably, recently these Foundational Audio Models, like SeamlessM4T, have started showing abilities to act as universal translators, supporting multiple speech tasks for up to 100 languages without any reliance on separate task-specific systems. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies regarding \textit{Foundational Large Audio Models}, their performance benchmarks, and their applicability to real-world scenarios. We also highlight current limitations and provide insights into potential future research directions in the realm of \textit{Large Audio Models} with the intent to spark further discussion, thereby fostering innovation in the next generation of audio-processing systems. Furthermore, to cope with the rapid development in this area, we will consistently update the relevant repository with relevant recent articles and their open-source implementations at https://github.com/EmulationAI/awesome-large-audio-models.

The concept is inspired by Wittgenstein's idea of the limits of one's world being determined by the bounds of their language. Using advanced AI tools like GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, the second iteration of the game enables the protagonist, Shahrzad, to realize words and stories in her world. The player can steer the conversation with the AI King towards specific keywords, which then become battle equipment in the game. This blend of interactive narrative and text-to-image transformation challenges the conventional border between the game world and reality through a dual perspective. We focus on Shahrzad, who seeks to alter her fate compared to the original folklore, and the player, who collaborates with AI to craft narratives and shape the game world. We explore the technical and design elements of implementing such a game with an objective to enhance the narrative game genre with AI-generated content and to delve into AI-native gameplay possibilities.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, which leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (OmniQuant) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights through a learnable equivalent transformation. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family with the size of 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4, W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

Under Review",,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recently, there has been growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific research. Numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the ability of LLMs for scientific research. However, current benchmarks are mostly based on pre-collected objective questions. This design suffers from data leakage problem and lacks the evaluation of subjective Q/A ability. In this paper, we propose SciEval, a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary evaluation benchmark to address these issues. Based on Bloom's taxonomy, SciEval covers four dimensions to systematically evaluate scientific research ability. In particular, we design a ""dynamic"" subset based on scientific principles to prevent evaluation from potential data leakage. Both objective and subjective questions are included in SciEval. These characteristics make SciEval a more effective benchmark for scientific research ability evaluation of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on most advanced LLMs show that, although GPT-4 achieves SOTA performance compared to other LLMs, there is still substantial room for improvement, especially for dynamic questions.

Even so, suffering from hallucinations and the inability to access external knowledge, LLMs often come with incorrect or unfaithful intermediate reasoning steps, especially in the context of answering knowledge-intensive tasks such as KBQA. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework called Knowledge-Driven Chain-of-Thought (KD-CoT) to verify and modify reasoning traces in CoT via interaction with external knowledge, and thus overcome the hallucinations and error propagation. Concretely, we formulate the CoT rationale process of LLMs into a structured multi-round QA format. In each round, LLMs interact with a QA system that retrieves external knowledge and produce faithful reasoning traces based on retrieved precise answers. The structured CoT reasoning of LLMs is facilitated by our developed KBQA CoT collection, which serves as in-context learning demonstrations and can also be utilized as feedback augmentation to train a robust retriever. Extensive experiments on WebQSP and ComplexWebQuestion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed KD-CoT in task-solving reasoning generation, which outperforms the vanilla CoT ICL with an absolute success rate of 8.0% and 5.1%. Furthermore, our proposed feedback-augmented retriever outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for retrieving knowledge, achieving significant improvement in Hit performance.

  Harman",COCO: Testing Code Generation Systems via Concretized Instructions,,,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Code generation systems have been extensively developed in recent years to generate source code based on natural language instructions. However, despite their advancements, these systems still face robustness issues where even slightly different instructions can result in significantly different code semantics. Robustness is critical for code generation systems, as it can have significant impacts on software development, software quality, and trust in the generated code. Although existing testing techniques for general text-to-text software can detect some robustness issues, they are limited in effectiveness due to ignoring the characteristics of code generation systems. In this work, we propose a novel technique COCO to test the robustness of code generation systems. It exploits the usage scenario of code generation systems to make the original programming instruction more concrete by incorporating features known to be contained in the original code. A robust system should maintain code semantics for the concretized instruction, and COCO detects robustness inconsistencies when it does not. We evaluated COCO on eight advanced code generation systems, including commercial tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT, using two widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of COCO in testing the robustness of code generation systems, outperforming two techniques adopted from general text-to-text software testing by 466.66% and 104.02%, respectively. Furthermore, concretized instructions generated by COCO can help reduce robustness inconsistencies by 18.35% to 53.91% through fine-tuning.

However, existing visual instruction tuning methods only utilize image-language instruction data to align the language and image modalities, lacking a more fine-grained cross-modal alignment. In this paper, we propose Position-enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning (PVIT), which extends the functionality of MLLMs by integrating an additional region-level vision encoder. This integration promotes a more detailed comprehension of images for the MLLM. In addition, to efficiently achieve a fine-grained alignment between the vision modules and the LLM, we design multiple data generation strategies to construct an image-region-language instruction dataset.

In natural science, traditional manual, serial, and labour-intensive work is being augmented by automated, parallel, and iterative processes driven by artificial intelligence-based experimental automation and more. To add new capabilities in natural science, enabling the acceleration and enrichment of automation of the discovery process, we present DARWIN, a series of tailored LLMs for natural science, mainly in physics, chemistry, and material science. This series relies on open-source LLM, incorporating structured and unstructured scientific knowledge from public datasets and literature. We fine-tuned the models using over 60,000 instruction data points, emphasizing factual correctness. During the fine-tuning, we introduce the Scientific Instruction Generation (SIG) model, automating instruction generation from scientific texts. This eliminates the need for manual extraction or domain-specific knowledge graphs and efficiently injects scientific knowledge into the model. We also explore multi-task training strategies, revealing interconnections between scientific tasks. DARWIN series not only achieves state-of-the-art results on various scientific tasks but also diminishes reliance on closed-source AI models. Our research showcases the ability of LLM in the scientific domain, with the overarching goal of fostering prosperity within the broader AI for science community.

In this paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness. For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and automatic manner, with only a few human participation. We hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs building. The MLLM-DataEngine has been open-sourced and is now available at https://github.com/opendatalab/MLLM-DataEngine.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based language model, Logical-GLM, to infuse logic into language models for more valid text generation and interpretability. Specifically, we first capture information from natural language instructions and construct logical bayes graphs that generally describe domains. Next, we generate logical skeletons to guide language model training, infusing domain knowledge into language models. Finally, we alternately optimize the searching policy of graphs and language models until convergence. The experimental results show that Logical-GLM is both effective and efficient compared with traditional language models, despite using smaller-scale training data and fewer parameters. Our approach can generate instructional texts with more correct logic owing to the internalized domain knowledge. Moreover, the usage of logical graphs reflects the inner mechanism of the language models, which improves the interpretability of black-box models.

In this work, we formalize a new task, Open-vocabulary Responsible Visual Synthesis (ORES), where the synthesis model is able to avoid forbidden visual concepts while allowing users to input any desired content. To address this problem, we present a Two-stage Intervention (TIN) framework. By introducing 1) rewriting with learnable instruction through a large-scale language model (LLM) and 2) synthesizing with prompt intervention on a diffusion synthesis model, it can effectively synthesize images avoiding any concepts but following the user's query as much as possible. To evaluate on ORES, we provide a publicly available dataset, baseline models, and benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing risks of image generation.

Existing works focus on solving MWPs with two types of solvers: tree-based solver and large language model (LLM) solver. However, these approaches always solve MWPs by a single solver, which will bring the following problems: (1) Single type of solver is hard to solve all types of MWPs well. (2) A single solver will result in poor performance due to over-fitting. To address these challenges, this paper utilizes multiple ensemble approaches to improve MWP-solving ability. Firstly, We propose a problem type classifier that combines the strengths of the tree-based solver and the LLM solver. This ensemble approach leverages their respective advantages and broadens the range of MWPs that can be solved. Furthermore, we also apply ensemble techniques to both tree-based solver and LLM solver to improve their performance. For the tree-based solver, we propose an ensemble learning framework based on ten-fold cross-validation and voting mechanism. In the LLM solver, we adopt self-consistency (SC) method to improve answer selection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these ensemble approaches in enhancing MWP-solving ability. The comprehensive evaluation showcases improved performance, validating the advantages of our proposed approach.

A comparative study between chatgpt and stack overflow,,,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Programmers often seek help from Q\&A websites to resolve issues they encounter during programming. Stack Overflow has been a widely used platform for this purpose for over a decade. Recently, revolutionary AI-powered platforms like ChatGPT have quickly gained popularity among programmers for their efficient and personalized programming assistance via natural language interactions. Both platforms can offer valuable assistance to programmers, but it's unclear which is more effective at enhancing programmer productivity. In our paper, we conducted an exploratory user study to compare the performance of Stack Overflow and ChatGPT in enhancing programmer productivity. Two groups of students with similar programming abilities were instructed to use the two platforms to solve three different types of programming tasks: algorithmic challenges, library usage, and debugging. During the experiments, we measured and compared the quality of code produced and the time taken to complete tasks for the two groups. The results show that, concerning code quality, ChatGPT outperforms Stack Overflow significantly in helping complete algorithmic and library-related tasks, while Stack Overflow is better for debugging tasks. Regarding task completion speed, the ChatGPT group is obviously faster than the Stack Overflow group in the algorithmic challenge, but the two groups have a similar performance in the other two tasks. Additionally, we conducted a post-experiment survey with the participants to understand how the platforms have helped them complete the programming tasks. We analyzed the questionnaires to summarize ChatGPT and Stack Overflow's strengths and weaknesses pointed out by the participants. By comparing these, we identified the reasons behind the two platforms' divergent performances in programming assistance.

Federated Learning (FL), a method to preserve user data privacy, is often employed in fine-tuning LLMs to downstream mobile tasks, an approach known as FedLLM. Though recent efforts have addressed the network issue induced by the vast model size, they have not practically mitigated vital challenges concerning integration with mobile devices, such as significant memory consumption and sluggish model convergence.   In response to these challenges, this work introduces FwdLLM, an innovative FL protocol designed to enhance the FedLLM efficiency. The key idea of FwdLLM to employ backpropagation (BP)-free training methods, requiring devices only to execute ``perturbed inferences''. Consequently, FwdLLM delivers way better memory efficiency and time efficiency (expedited by mobile NPUs and an expanded array of participant devices). FwdLLM centers around three key designs: (1) it combines BP-free training with parameter-efficient training methods, an essential way to scale the approach to the LLM era; (2) it systematically and adaptively allocates computational loads across devices, striking a careful balance between convergence speed and accuracy; (3) it discriminatively samples perturbed predictions that are more valuable to model convergence. Comprehensive experiments with five LLMs and three NLP tasks illustrate FwdLLM's significant advantages over conventional methods, including up to three orders of magnitude faster convergence and a 14.6x reduction in memory footprint. Uniquely, FwdLLM paves the way for federated learning of billion-parameter LLMs such as LLaMA on COTS mobile devices -- a feat previously unattained.

  Yanghua Xiao","Translate Meanings, Not Just Words: IdiomKB's Role in Optimizing Idiomatic Translation with Language Models",Work in progress,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  To translate well, machine translation (MT) systems and general-purposed language models (LMs) need a deep understanding of both source and target languages and cultures. Therefore, idioms, with their non-compositional nature, pose particular challenges for Transformer-based systems, as literal translations often miss the intended meaning. Traditional methods, which replace idioms using existing knowledge bases (KBs), often lack scale and context awareness. Addressing these challenges, our approach prioritizes context awareness and scalability, allowing for offline storage of idioms in a manageable KB size. This ensures efficient serving with smaller models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of idiomatic expressions. We introduce a multilingual idiom KB (IdiomKB) developed using large LMs to address this.

  Ren, Zhumin Chen, Jun Ma",Confucius: Iterative Tool Learning from Introspection Feedback by Easy-to-Difficult Curriculum,,,,,cs.AI cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a promising approach to extending the capability of LLMs. Although some works employ open-source LLMs for the tool learning task, most of them are trained in a controlled environment in which LLMs only learn to execute the human-provided tools. However, selecting proper tools from the large toolset is also a crucial ability for the tool learning model to be applied in real-world applications. Existing methods usually directly employ self-instruction methods to train the model, which ignores differences in tool complexity. In this paper, we propose the Confucius, a novel tool learning framework to train LLM to use complicated tools in real-world scenarios, which contains two main phases: (1) We first propose a multi-stage learning method to teach the LLM to use various tools from an easy-to-difficult curriculum; (2) thenceforth, we propose the Iterative Self-instruct from Introspective Feedback (ISIF) to dynamically construct the dataset to improve the ability to use the complicated tool. Extensive experiments conducted on both controlled and real-world settings demonstrate the superiority of our tool learning framework in the real-world application scenarios compared to both tuning-free (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude) and tuning-based baselines (e.g. GPT4Tools).

In recent, promising results have been attained by Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods through trial and error in simulators, bringing confidence in solving cities' congestion headaches. However, there still exist performance gaps when simulator-trained policies are deployed to the real world. This issue is mainly introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulator and the real-world environments. The Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on mass knowledge and proved to be equipped with astonishing inference abilities. In this work, we leverage LLMs to understand and profile the system dynamics by a prompt-based grounded action transformation. Accepting the cloze prompt template, and then filling in the answer based on accessible context, the pre-trained LLM's inference ability is exploited and applied to understand how weather conditions, traffic states, and road types influence traffic dynamics, being aware of this, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus help the agent learn a more realistic policy. We conduct experiments using DQN to show the effectiveness of the proposed PromptGAT's ability in mitigating the performance gap from simulation to reality (sim-to-real).

  Xu",EdgeMoE: Fast On-Device Inference of MoE-based Large Language Models,,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs and LLaMa have ushered in a revolution in machine intelligence, owing to their exceptional capabilities in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, the transition of LLMs from data centers to edge devices presents a set of challenges and opportunities. While this shift can enhance privacy and availability, it is hampered by the enormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs. In light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device inference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant of sparse LLMs that exhibit nearly constant computational complexity as their parameter size scales. EdgeMoE achieves both memory and computational efficiency by strategically partitioning the model across the storage hierarchy. Specifically, non-expert weights are stored in the device's memory, while expert weights are kept in external storage and are fetched into memory only when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight that expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse activation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert I/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise bitwidth adaptation: This method reduces the size of expert weights with an acceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the experts that will be activated in advance and preloads them into the compute-I/O pipeline, thus further optimizing the process. In empirical evaluations conducted on well-established MoE LLMs and various edge devices, EdgeMoE demonstrates substantial memory savings and performance improvements when compared to competitive baseline solutions.

A key realization driving this work is the notable fragmentation among these models, characterized by varied architectures, operators, and implementations. This fragmentation imposes a significant burden on the comprehensive optimization of hardware, system settings, and algorithms.   Buoyed by the recent strides in large foundation models, this work introduces a pioneering paradigm for mobile AI: a collaborative management approach between the mobile OS and hardware, overseeing a foundational model capable of serving a broad spectrum of mobile AI tasks, if not all. This foundational model resides within the NPU and remains impervious to app or OS revisions, akin to firmware. Concurrently, each app contributes a concise, offline fine-tuned ""adapter"" tailored to distinct downstream tasks. From this concept emerges a concrete instantiation known as \sys. It amalgamates a curated selection of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) and facilitates dynamic data flow. This concept's viability is substantiated through the creation of an exhaustive benchmark encompassing 38 mobile AI tasks spanning 50 datasets, including domains such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), audio, sensing, and multimodal inputs. Spanning this benchmark, \sys unveils its impressive performance. It attains accuracy parity in 85\% of tasks, demonstrates improved scalability in terms of storage and memory, and offers satisfactory inference speed on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile devices fortified with NPU support.

In this research, we introduce a technique that enables the control of arbitrary styles by leveraging natural language as emotion prompts. This technique presents benefits in terms of both flexibility and user-friendliness. To realize this objective, we initially construct a Text-Expression Alignment Dataset (TEAD), wherein each facial expression is paired with several prompt-like descriptions.We propose an innovative automatic annotation method, supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), to expedite the dataset construction, thereby eliminating the substantial expense of manual annotation. Following this, we utilize TEAD to train a CLIP-based model, termed ExpCLIP, which encodes text and facial expressions into semantically aligned style embeddings. The embeddings are subsequently integrated into the facial animation generator to yield expressive and controllable facial animations. Given the limited diversity of facial emotions in existing speech-driven facial animation training data, we further introduce an effective Expression Prompt Augmentation (EPA) mechanism to enable the animation generator to support unprecedented richness in style control. Comprehensive experiments illustrate that our method accomplishes expressive facial animation generation and offers enhanced flexibility in effectively conveying the desired style.

Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs' long context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated memory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating long context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench, the first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench comprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese, with an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters (Chinese). These tasks cover key long-text application areas including single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. All datasets in LongBench are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Upon comprehensive evaluation of 8 LLMs on LongBench, we find that: (1) Commercial model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k) outperforms other open-sourced models, but still struggles on longer contexts. (2) Scaled position embedding and fine-tuning on longer sequences lead to substantial improvement on long context understanding. (3) Context compression technique such as retrieval brings improvement for model with weak ability on long contexts, but the performance still lags behind models that have strong long context understanding capability.

LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education, specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various prompting techniques such as zero- and few-shot method (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step), in-domain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% -> 63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -> 48.6%). We found that models of different sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational communication.

  Tao, Li Guo",Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Most open-domain dialogue systems suffer from forgetting important information, especially in a long-term conversation. Existing works usually train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. Code and scripts will be released later.

  Robert Schober",LAMBO: Large Language Model Empowered Edge Intelligence,To be submitted for possible journal publication,,,,cs.AI cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Next-generation edge intelligence is anticipated to bring huge benefits to various applications, e.g., offloading systems. However, traditional deep offloading architectures face several issues, including heterogeneous constraints, partial perception, uncertain generalization, and lack of tractability. In this context, the integration of offloading with large language models (LLMs) presents numerous advantages. Therefore, we propose an LLM-Based Offloading (LAMBO) framework for mobile edge computing (MEC), which comprises four components: (i) Input embedding (IE), which is used to represent the information of the offloading system with constraints and prompts through learnable vectors with high quality; (ii) Asymmetric encoderdecoder (AED) model, which is a decision-making module with a deep encoder and a shallow decoder. It can achieve high performance based on multi-head self-attention schemes; (iii) Actor-critic reinforcement learning (ACRL) module, which is employed to pre-train the whole AED for different optimization tasks under corresponding prompts; and (iv) Active learning from expert feedback (ALEF), which can be used to finetune the decoder part of the AED while adapting to dynamic environmental changes. Our simulation results corroborate the advantages of the proposed LAMBO framework.

Hallucination refers to the information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models (HaELM), an LLM-based hallucination evaluation framework. HaELM achieves an approximate 95% performance comparable to ChatGPT and has additional advantages including low cost, reproducibility, privacy preservation and local deployment. Leveraging the HaELM, we evaluate the hallucination in current LVLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the factors contributing to hallucination in LVLMs and offer helpful suggestions to mitigate the hallucination problem.

In this work, we propose a framework for driving legged robots act like real animals with lifelike agility and strategy in complex environments. Inspired by large pre-trained models witnessed with impressive performance in language and image understanding, we introduce the power of advanced deep generative models to produce motor control signals stimulating legged robots to act like real animals. Unlike conventional controllers and end-to-end RL methods that are task-specific, we propose to pre-train generative models over animal motion datasets to preserve expressive knowledge of animal behavior. The pre-trained model holds sufficient primitive-level knowledge yet is environment-agnostic. It is then reused for a successive stage of learning to align with the environments by traversing a number of challenging obstacles that are rarely considered in previous approaches, including creeping through narrow spaces, jumping over hurdles, freerunning over scattered blocks, etc. Finally, a task-specific controller is trained to solve complex downstream tasks by reusing the knowledge from previous stages. Enriching the knowledge regarding each stage does not affect the usage of other levels of knowledge. This flexible framework offers the possibility of continual knowledge accumulation at different levels. We successfully apply the trained multi-level controllers to the MAX robot, a quadrupedal robot developed in-house, to mimic animals, traverse complex obstacles, and play in a designed challenging multi-agent Chase Tag Game, where lifelike agility and strategy emerge on the robots. The present research pushes the frontier of robot control with new insights on reusing multi-level pre-trained knowledge and solving highly complex downstream tasks in the real world.

This situation underscores a profound need for trained psychological counselors who can enact effective mental interventions. However, the development of these professionals is often an imperative but time-consuming task. Consequently, the mobilization of non-professionals or volunteers in this capacity emerges as a pressing concern. Leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, and in particular, the recent advances in large language models, offers a viable solution to this challenge. This paper introduces a novel model constructed on the foundation of large language models to fully assist non-professionals in providing psychological interventions on online user discourses. This framework makes it plausible to harness the power of non-professional counselors in a meaningful way. A comprehensive study was conducted involving ten professional psychological counselors of varying expertise, evaluating the system across five critical dimensions. The findings affirm that our system is capable of analyzing patients' issues with relative accuracy and proffering professional-level strategies recommendations, thereby enhancing support for non-professionals. This research serves as a compelling validation of the application of large language models in the field of psychology and lays the groundwork for a new paradigm of community-based mental health support.

However, existing approaches suffer from poor scalability due to the limited language understanding ability and the non-trivial manual efforts required from developers or end-users. The recent advance of large language models (LLMs) in language understanding and reasoning inspires us to rethink the problem from a model-centric perspective, where task preparation, comprehension, and execution are handled by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce AutoDroid, a mobile task automation system that can handle arbitrary tasks on any Android application without manual efforts. The key insight is to combine the commonsense knowledge of LLMs and domain-specific knowledge of apps through automated dynamic analysis. The main components include a functionality-aware UI representation method that bridges the UI with the LLM, exploration-based memory injection techniques that augment the app-specific domain knowledge of LLM, and a multi-granularity query optimization module that reduces the cost of model inference. We integrate AutoDroid with off-the-shelf LLMs including online GPT-4/GPT-3.5 and on-device Vicuna, and evaluate its performance on a new benchmark for memory-augmented Android task automation with 158 common tasks. The results demonstrated that AutoDroid is able to precisely generate actions with an accuracy of 90.9%, and complete tasks with a success rate of 71.3%, outperforming the GPT-4-powered baselines by 36.4% and 39.7%.

Fault localisation is instrumental in enabling automated debugging and repair of programs and was prominently featured as a highlight during the launch event of ChatGPT-4. Nevertheless, the performance of LLMs compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the impact of prompt design and context length on their efficacy, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper presents an in-depth investigation into the capability of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, the two state-of-the-art LLMs, on fault localisation. Using the widely-adopted large-scale Defects4J dataset, we compare the two LLMs with the existing fault localisation techniques. We also investigate the consistency of LLMs in fault localisation, as well as how prompt engineering and the length of code context affect the fault localisation effectiveness.   Our findings demonstrate that within function-level context, ChatGPT-4 outperforms all the existing fault localisation methods. Additional error logs can further improve ChatGPT models' localisation accuracy and consistency, with an average 46.9% higher accuracy over the state-of-the-art baseline SmartFL on the Defects4J dataset in terms of TOP-1 metric. However, when the code context of the Defects4J dataset expands to the class-level, ChatGPT-4's performance suffers a significant drop, with 49.9% lower accuracy than SmartFL under TOP-1 metric. These observations indicate that although ChatGPT can effectively localise faults under specific conditions, limitations are evident. Further research is needed to fully harness the potential of LLMs like ChatGPT for practical fault localisation applications.

However, the absence of a systematical benchmark inhibits the development of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions. To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including question representation, example selection and example organization, and with these experimental results, we elaborate their pros and cons. Based on these findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes the Spider leaderboard with 86.6% execution accuracy and sets a new bar. To explore the potential of open-source LLM, we investigate them in various scenarios, and further enhance their performance with supervised fine-tuning. Our explorations highlight open-source LLMs' potential in Text-to-SQL, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution, we emphasize the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior studies under this metric. We hope that our work provides a deeper understanding of Text-to-SQL with LLMs, and inspires further investigations and broad applications.

Despite their strong abilities in recognizing common objects due to extensive training datasets, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of localized details within objects, which hinders their effectiveness in the Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) task. On the other hand, most existing IAD methods only provide anomaly scores and necessitate the manual setting of thresholds to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples, which restricts their practical implementation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of LVLM to address the IAD problem and propose AnomalyGPT, a novel IAD approach based on LVLM. We generate training data by simulating anomalous images and producing corresponding textual descriptions for each image. We also employ an image decoder to provide fine-grained semantic and design a prompt learner to fine-tune the LVLM using prompt embeddings. Our AnomalyGPT eliminates the need for manual threshold adjustments, thus directly assesses the presence and locations of anomalies. Additionally, AnomalyGPT supports multi-turn dialogues and exhibits impressive few-shot in-context learning capabilities. With only one normal shot, AnomalyGPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 86.1%, an image-level AUC of 94.1%, and a pixel-level AUC of 95.3% on the MVTec-AD dataset.

Although there are effective methods like program-of-thought prompting for LLMs which uses programming language to tackle complex reasoning tasks, the specific impact of code data on the improvement of reasoning capabilities remains under-explored. To address this gap, we propose complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS), which combines structural and logical attributes, to measure the correlation between code and reasoning abilities. Specifically, we use the abstract syntax tree to encode the structural information and calculate logical complexity by considering the difficulty and the cyclomatic complexity. Through an empirical analysis, we find not all code data of complexity can be learned or understood by LLMs. Optimal level of complexity is critical to the improvement of reasoning abilities by program-aided prompting. Then we design an auto-synthesizing and stratifying algorithm, and apply it to instruction generation for mathematical reasoning and code data filtering for code generation tasks. Extensive results demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Code will be integrated into the EasyInstruct framework at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct.

As the scale of datasets continues to grow, privacy risks arising from memorization have attracted increasing attention. Quantifying language model memorization helps evaluate potential privacy risks. However, prior works on quantifying memorization require access to the precise original data or incur substantial computational overhead, making it difficult for applications in real-world language models. To this end, we propose a fine-grained, entity-level definition to quantify memorization with conditions and metrics closer to real-world scenarios. In addition, we also present an approach for efficiently extracting sensitive entities from autoregressive language models. We conduct extensive experiments based on the proposed, probing language models' ability to reconstruct sensitive entities under different settings. We find that language models have strong memorization at the entity level and are able to reproduce the training data even with partial leakages. The results demonstrate that LLMs not only memorize their training data but also understand associations between entities. These findings necessitate that trainers of LLMs exercise greater prudence regarding model memorization, adopting memorization mitigation techniques to preclude privacy violations.

Being a prevalent compression technique, quantization has emerged as the mainstream practice to tackle this issue, which is mainly centered on two recipes W8A8 and W4A16 (i.e. weights and activations in such bit widths). In this study, we propose a novel W4A8 post-training quantization method for the available open-sourced LLMs, which combines the advantages of both two recipes. Therefore, we can leverage the benefit in the I/O utilization of 4-bit weight quantization and the acceleration due to 8-bit matrix computation. Nevertheless, the W4A8 faces notorious performance degradation. As a remedy, we involve layerwise activation quantization strategies which feature a novel logarithmic equalization for most intractable layers, and we combine them with fine-grained weight quantization. Without whistles and bells, we eliminate the necessity for further fine-tuning and obtain the state-of-the-art W4A8 quantized performance on BLOOM, LLaMA, and LLaMA-2 on standard benchmarks. We confirm that the W4A8 quantization is achievable for the deployment of large language models, fostering their wide-spreading real-world applications.

Multimodal instruction-following models extend these capabilities by integrating both text and images. However, existing models such as MiniGPT-4 face challenges in maintaining dialogue coherence in scenarios involving multiple images. A primary reason is the lack of a specialized dataset for this critical application. To bridge these gaps, we present SparklesChat, a multimodal instruction-following model for open-ended dialogues across multiple images. To support the training, we introduce SparklesDialogue, the first machine-generated dialogue dataset tailored for word-level interleaved multi-image and text interactions. Furthermore, we construct SparklesEval, a GPT-assisted benchmark for quantitatively assessing a model's conversational competence across multiple images and dialogue turns. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of SparklesChat in understanding and reasoning across multiple images and dialogue turns. Specifically, SparklesChat outperformed MiniGPT-4 on established vision-and-language benchmarks, including the BISON binary image selection task and the NLVR2 visual reasoning task. Moreover, SparklesChat scored 8.56 out of 10 on SparklesEval, substantially exceeding MiniGPT-4's score of 3.91 and nearing GPT-4's score of 9.26.

Current MLLMs typically begin by using LLMs to decompose tasks into multiple subtasks, then employing individual pre-trained models to complete specific subtasks, and ultimately utilizing LLMs to integrate the results of each subtasks to obtain the results of the task. In real-world scenarios, when dealing with large projects, it is common practice to break down the project into smaller sub-projects, with different teams providing corresponding solutions or results. The project owner then decides which solution or result to use, ensuring the best possible outcome for each subtask and, consequently, for the entire project. Inspired by this, this study considers selecting multiple pre-trained models to complete the same subtask. By combining the results from multiple pre-trained models, the optimal subtask result is obtained, enhancing the performance of the MLLM. Specifically, this study first selects multiple pre-trained models focused on the same subtask based on distinct evaluation approaches, and then invokes these models in parallel to process input data and generate corresponding subtask results. Finally, the results from multiple pre-trained models for the same subtask are compared using the LLM, and the best result is chosen as the outcome for that subtask.

Despite their ability to act as lightweight domain experts, they struggle to perform versatile tasks such as providing explanations and engaging in conversations. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) represent a significant step towards artificial general intelligence, showcasing remarkable capabilities in instruction comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and human interaction. However, LLMs lack the knowledge of domain-specific item catalogs and behavioral patterns, particularly in areas that diverge from general world knowledge, such as online e-commerce. Finetuning LLMs for each domain is neither economic nor efficient.   In this paper, we bridge the gap between recommender models and LLMs, combining their respective strengths to create a versatile and interactive recommender system. We introduce an efficient framework called InteRecAgent, which employs LLMs as the brain and recommender models as tools. We first outline a minimal set of essential tools required to transform LLMs into InteRecAgent. We then propose an efficient workflow within InteRecAgent for task execution, incorporating key components such as a memory bus, dynamic demonstration-augmented task planning, and reflection. InteRecAgent enables traditional recommender systems, such as those ID-based matrix factorization models, to become interactive systems with a natural language interface through the integration of LLMs. Experimental results on several public datasets show that InteRecAgent achieves satisfying performance as a conversational recommender system, outperforming general-purpose LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:36:44 GMT'}, {'version': 'v2', 'created': 'Fri, 1 Sep 2023 15:40:16 GMT'}]",2023-09-04,"[['Huang', 'Xu', ''], ['Lian', 'Jianxun', ''], ['Lei', 'Yuxuan', ''], ['Yao', 'Jing', ''], ['Lian', 'Defu', ''], ['Xie', 'Xing', '']]",0,0,2023-08-31,2,6,2,0,0,0,c237a22698223e4060d83027f399f4fb2aa24291,261395685.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c237a22698223e4060d83027f399f4fb2aa24291,arXiv.org,2023.0,51.0,5.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2236672137', 'name': 'Xu Huang'}, {'authorId': '2813328', 'name': 'Jianxun Lian'}, {'authorId': '2226475380', 'name': 'Yuxuan Lei'}, {'authorId': '2237129499', 'name': 'Jing Yao'}, {'authorId': '1862782', 'name': 'Defu Lian'}, {'authorId': '2110972323', 'name': 'Xing Xie'}]","['University of Science and Technology of China', 'Microsoft']",['China'],2023-08

However, existing speech tokens are not specifically designed for speech language modeling. To assess the suitability of speech tokens for building speech language models, we established the first benchmark, SLMTokBench. Our results indicate that neither semantic nor acoustic tokens are ideal for this purpose. Therefore, we propose SpeechTokenizer, a unified speech tokenizer for speech large language models. SpeechTokenizer adopts the Encoder-Decoder architecture with residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unifying semantic and acoustic tokens, SpeechTokenizer disentangles different aspects of speech information hierarchically across different RVQ layers. Furthermore, We construct a Unified Speech Language Model (USLM) leveraging SpeechTokenizer. Experiments show that SpeechTokenizer performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction and demonstrates strong performance on the SLMTokBench benchmark. Also, USLM outperforms VALL-E in zero-shot Text-to-Speech tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ZhangXInFD/SpeechTokenizer/.

Project page: https://runsenxu.com/projects/PointLLM",,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created a profound impact on natural language processing but are yet to fully embrace the realm of 3D understanding. This paper introduces PointLLM, a preliminary effort to fill this gap, thereby enabling LLMs to understand point clouds and offering a new avenue beyond 2D visual data. PointLLM processes colored object point clouds with human instructions and generates contextually appropriate responses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense. Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM to effectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. We collect a novel dataset comprising 660K simple and 70K complex point-text instruction pairs to enable a two-stage training strategy: initially aligning latent spaces and subsequently instruction-tuning the unified model. To rigorously evaluate our model's perceptual abilities and its generalization capabilities, we establish two benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D Object Captioning, assessed through three different methods, including human evaluation, GPT-4/ChatGPT evaluation, and traditional metrics. Experiment results show that PointLLM demonstrates superior performance over existing 2D baselines. Remarkably, in human-evaluated object captioning tasks, PointLLM outperforms human annotators in over 50% of the samples.

Recent works explore vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when meet with ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel decomposition-aggregation framework, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to enrich semantic contexts. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labelling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation is further designed to achieve multi-level alignment and deep fusion between vision and text. The final result is obtained by computing the embedding similarity between aggregated attributes and images. To evaluate the effectiveness, we annotate three datasets with attribute descriptions, and conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies. The results show the superior performance of attribute decomposition-aggregation.

Although usually the architecture and constituent building blocks of neural networks allow them to be used in a modular way, their training process is not aware of this modularity. Consequently, conventional neural network training lacks the flexibility to adapt the computational load of the model during inference. This paper proposes SortedNet, a generalized and scalable solution to harness the inherent modularity of deep neural networks across various dimensions for efficient dynamic inference. Our training considers a nested architecture for the sub-models with shared parameters and trains them together with the main model in a sorted and probabilistic manner. This sorted training of sub-networks enables us to scale the number of sub-networks to hundreds using a single round of training. We utilize a novel updating scheme during training that combines random sampling of sub-networks with gradient accumulation to improve training efficiency. Furthermore, the sorted nature of our training leads to a search-free sub-network selection at inference time; and the nested architecture of the resulting sub-networks leads to minimal storage requirement and efficient switching between sub-networks at inference. Our general dynamic training approach is demonstrated across various architectures and tasks, including large language models and pre-trained vision models. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving efficient sub-networks while outperforming state-of-the-art dynamic training approaches. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of training up to 160 different sub-models simultaneously, showcasing the extensive scalability of our proposed method while maintaining 96% of the model performance.

Different entities can further improve the performance of those LLMs on their specific downstream tasks by fine-tuning LLMs. When several entities have similar interested tasks, but their data cannot be shared because of privacy concerns regulations, federated learning (FL) is a mainstream solution to leverage the data of different entities. However, fine-tuning LLMs in federated learning settings still lacks adequate support from existing FL frameworks because it has to deal with optimizing the consumption of significant communication and computational resources, data preparation for different tasks, and distinct information protection demands. This paper first discusses these challenges of federated fine-tuning LLMs, and introduces our package FS-LLM as a main contribution, which consists of the following components: (1) we build an end-to-end benchmarking pipeline, automizing the processes of dataset preprocessing, federated fine-tuning execution, and performance evaluation on federated LLM fine-tuning; (2) we provide comprehensive federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithm implementations and versatile programming interfaces for future extension in FL scenarios with low communication and computation costs, even without accessing the full model; (3) we adopt several accelerating and resource-efficient operators for fine-tuning LLMs with limited resources and the flexible pluggable sub-routines for interdisciplinary study. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of FS-LLM and benchmark advanced LLMs with state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithms in FL settings, which also yields valuable insights into federated fine-tuning LLMs for the research community.

However, modality alignment between speech and text still remains an open problem. Current solutions can be categorized into two strategies. One is a cascaded approach where outputs (tokens or states) of a separately trained speech recognition system are used as inputs for LLMs, which limits their potential in modeling alignment between speech and text. The other is an end-to-end approach that relies on speech instruction data, which is very difficult to collect in large quantities. In this paper, we address these issues and propose the BLSP approach that Bootstraps Language-Speech Pre-training via behavior alignment of continuation writing. We achieve this by learning a lightweight modality adapter between a frozen speech encoder and an LLM, ensuring that the LLM exhibits the same generation behavior regardless of the modality of input: a speech segment or its transcript. The training process can be divided into two steps. The first step prompts an LLM to generate texts with speech transcripts as prefixes, obtaining text continuations. In the second step, these continuations are used as supervised signals to train the modality adapter in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that this straightforward process can extend the capabilities of LLMs to speech, enabling speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language understanding, and speech conversation, even in zero-shot cross-lingual scenarios.

To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope.

Business process document generation is a crucial stage in BPM. However, due to a shortage of datasets, data-driven deep learning techniques struggle to deliver the expected results. We propose an approach to transform Conditional Process Trees (CPTs) into Business Process Text Sketches (BPTSs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The traditional prompting approach (Few-shot In-Context Learning) tries to get the correct answer in one go, and it can find the pattern of transforming simple CPTs into BPTSs, but for close-domain and CPTs with complex hierarchy, the traditional prompts perform weakly and with low correctness. We suggest using this technique to break down a difficult CPT into a number of basic CPTs and then solve each one in turn, drawing inspiration from the divide-and-conquer strategy. We chose 100 process trees with depths ranging from 2 to 5 at random, as well as CPTs with many nodes, many degrees of selection, and cyclic nesting. Experiments show that our method can achieve a correct rate of 93.42%, which is 45.17% better than traditional prompting methods. Our proposed method provides a solution for business process document generation in the absence of datasets, and secondly, it becomes potentially possible to provide a large number of datasets for the process model extraction (PME) domain.

Its challenge lies in object categories available for the task being too diverse to be limited to a closed set of object vocabulary for traditional object detection. Simply mapping categories and visual features of common objects to the task cannot address the challenge. In this paper, we propose to explore fundamental affordances rather than object categories, i.e., common attributes that enable different objects to accomplish the same task. Moreover, we propose a novel multi-level chain-of-thought prompting (MLCoT) to extract the affordance knowledge from large language models, which contains multi-level reasoning steps from task to object examples to essential visual attributes with rationales. Furthermore, to fully exploit knowledge to benefit object recognition and localization, we propose a knowledge-conditional detection framework, namely CoTDet. It conditions the detector from the knowledge to generate object queries and regress boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoTDet outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently and significantly (+15.6 box AP and +14.8 mask AP) and can generate rationales for why objects are detected to afford the task.

However, most of related work treat LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g., as a feature extractor) which may not be able to fully leverage the generative power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple stages such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods and future directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions: 1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for various RS tasks.

However, the multimodal SC has several challenges, including data heterogeneity, semantic ambiguity, and signal fading. Recent advancements in large AI models, particularly in Multimodal Language Model (MLM) and Large Language Model (LLM), offer potential solutions for these issues. To this end, we propose a Large AI Model-based Multimodal SC (LAM-MSC) framework, in which we first present the MLM-based Multimodal Alignment (MMA) that utilizes the MLM to enable the transformation between multimodal and unimodal data while preserving semantic consistency. Then, a personalized LLM-based Knowledge Base (LKB) is proposed, which allows users to perform personalized semantic extraction or recovery through the LLM. This effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity. Finally, we apply the Conditional Generative adversarial networks-based channel Estimation (CGE) to obtain Channel State Information (CSI). This approach effectively mitigates the impact of fading channels in SC. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the superior performance of the LAM-MSC framework.

However, the grounding problem still hinders the applications of LLMs in the real-world environment. Existing studies try to fine-tune the LLM or utilize pre-defined behavior APIs to bridge the LLMs and the environment, which not only costs huge human efforts to customize for every single task but also weakens the generality strengths of LLMs. To autonomously ground the LLM onto the environment, we proposed the Self-Driven Grounding (SDG) framework to automatically and progressively ground the LLM with self-driven skill learning. SDG first employs the LLM to propose the hypothesis of sub-goals to achieve tasks and then verify the feasibility of the hypothesis via interacting with the underlying environment. Once verified, SDG can then learn generalized skills with the guidance of these successfully grounded subgoals. These skills can be further utilized to accomplish more complex tasks which fail to pass the verification phase. Verified in the famous instruction following task set-BabyAI, SDG achieves comparable performance in the most challenging tasks compared with imitation learning methods that cost millions of demonstrations, proving the effectiveness of learned skills and showing the feasibility and efficiency of our framework.

Information extraction is the strategy to transform the sequence of characters into structured data, which can be employed for secondary analysis. However, the traditional information extraction components, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, require annotated data to optimize the model parameters, which has become one of the major bottlenecks in building information extraction systems. With the large language models achieving good performances on various downstream NLP tasks without parameter tuning, it becomes possible to use large language models for zero-shot information extraction. In this study, we aim to explore whether the most popular large language model, ChatGPT, can extract useful information from the radiological reports. We first design the prompt template for the interested information in the CT reports. Then, we generate the prompts by combining the prompt template with the CT reports as the inputs of ChatGPT to obtain the responses. A post-processing module is developed to transform the responses into structured extraction results. We conducted the experiments with 847 CT reports collected from Peking University Cancer Hospital. The experimental results indicate that ChatGPT can achieve competitive performances for some extraction tasks compared with the baseline information extraction system, but some limitations need to be further improved.

However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 4 Sep 2023 08:28:44 GMT'}]",2023-09-06,"[['Chen', 'Jiawei', ''], ['Lin', 'Hongyu', ''], ['Han', 'Xianpei', ''], ['Sun', 'Le', '']]",0,0,2023-09-04,1,4,1,0,0,0,28e2ecb4183ebc0eec504b12dddc677f8aef8745,261530434.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28e2ecb4183ebc0eec504b12dddc677f8aef8745,arXiv.org,2023.0,48.0,4.0,1.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2115448879', 'name': 'Jiawei Chen'}, {'authorId': '2116455765', 'name': 'Hongyu Lin'}, {'authorId': '2118233348', 'name': 'Xianpei Han'}, {'authorId': '2110832778', 'name': 'Le Sun'}]","['University of Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences', 'Chinese Information Processing Laboratory']",['China'],2023-09

To address this issue, this study compared the revised Chinese to English translation texts produced by Chinese Master of Translation and Interpretation (MTI) students,who learned English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL), based on three feedback types (i.e., ChatGPT-based feedback, TF and SF). The data was analyzed using BLEU score to gauge the overall translation quality as well as Coh-Metrix to examine linguistic features across three dimensions: lexicon, syntax, and cohesion.The findings revealed that TF- and SF-guided translation texts surpassed those with ChatGPT-based feedback, as indicated by the BLEU score. In terms of linguistic features,ChatGPT-based feedback demonstrated superiority, particularly in enhancing lexical capability and referential cohesion in the translation texts. However, TF and SF proved more effective in developing syntax-related skills,as it addressed instances of incorrect usage of the passive voice.

However, there are few studies to examine the security of LLMs in math solving ability. Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of security in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts. Finally, we hope our practice and observation can serve as an important attempt towards enhancing the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. We will release our code and dataset.

Existing studies have demonstrated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of LLMs in various natural language processing tasks. However, the question of how to further enhance LLMs' performance in specific task using prompting strategies remains a pivotal concern. This paper explores the enhancement of LLMs' performance in sentiment analysis through the application of prompting strategies. We formulate the process of prompting for sentiment analysis tasks and introduce two novel strategies tailored for sentiment analysis: RolePlaying (RP) prompting and Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Specifically, we also propose the RP-CoT prompting strategy which is a combination of RP prompting and CoT prompting. We conduct comparative experiments on three distinct domain datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed sentiment analysis strategies. The results demonstrate that the adoption of the proposed prompting strategies leads to a increasing enhancement in sentiment analysis accuracy. Further, the CoT prompting strategy exhibits a notable impact on implicit sentiment analysis, with the RP-CoT prompting strategy delivering the most superior performance among all strategies.

However, recent studies have revealed that these models often suffer from hallucinations, leading to overly confident but incorrect judgments. This limits their application in the medical domain, where tasks require the utmost accuracy. This paper introduces an automated evaluation framework that assesses the practical capabilities of LLMs as virtual doctors during multi-turn consultations. Consultation tasks are designed to require LLMs to be aware of what they do not know, to inquire about missing medical information from patients, and to ultimately make diagnoses. To evaluate the performance of LLMs for these tasks, a benchmark is proposed by reformulating medical multiple-choice questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examinations (USMLE), and comprehensive evaluation metrics are developed and evaluated on three constructed test sets. A medical consultation training set is further constructed to improve the consultation ability of LLMs. The results of the experiments show that fine-tuning with the training set can alleviate hallucinations and improve LLMs' performance on the proposed benchmark. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

  and Yunbo Cao and Tianyu Liu and Zhifang Sui",Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment,Large Language Models; Reasoning; Alignment,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Reasoning is a cognitive process of using evidence to reach a sound conclusion. The reasoning capability is essential for large language models (LLMs) to serve as the brain of the artificial general intelligence agent. Recent studies reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on data with the chain of thought (COT) reasoning process can significantly enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs suffer from an \textit{Assessment Misalignment} problem, i.e., they frequently assign higher scores to subpar COTs, leading to potential limitations in their reasoning abilities. To address this problem, we introduce an \textit{Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)} paradigm, which involves three steps: 1) fine-tuning LLMs with COT training data; 2) generating multiple COT responses for each question, and categorizing them into positive and negative ones based on whether they achieve the correct answer; 3) calibrating the scores of positive and negative responses given by LLMs with a novel constraint alignment loss. Specifically, the constraint alignment loss has two objectives: a) Alignment, which guarantees that positive scores surpass negative scores to encourage answers with high-quality COTs; b) Constraint, which keeps the negative scores confined to a reasonable range to prevent the model degradation. Beyond just the binary positive and negative feedback, the constraint alignment loss can be seamlessly adapted to the ranking situations when ranking feedback is accessible. Furthermore, we also delve deeply into recent ranking-based alignment methods, such as DPO, RRHF, and PRO, and discover that the constraint, which has been overlooked by these approaches, is also crucial for their performance. Extensive experiments on four reasoning benchmarks with both binary and ranking feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of AFT.

Nevertheless, these Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are suffering from the drawback of hallucination -- due to insufficient understanding of vision and language modalities, VLMs may generate incorrect perception information when doing downstream applications, for example, captioning a non-existent entity. To address the hallucination phenomenon, on the one hand, we introduce a Contrastive Instruction Evaluation Method (CIEM), which is an automatic pipeline that leverages an annotated image-text dataset coupled with an LLM to generate factual/contrastive question-answer pairs for the evaluation of the hallucination of VLMs. On the other hand, based on CIEM, we further propose a new instruction tuning method called CIT (the abbreviation of Contrastive Instruction Tuning) to alleviate the hallucination of VLMs by automatically producing high-quality factual/contrastive question-answer pairs and corresponding justifications for model tuning. Through extensive experiments on CIEM and CIT, we pinpoint the hallucination issues commonly present in existing VLMs, the disability of the current instruction-tuning dataset to handle the hallucination phenomenon and the superiority of CIT-tuned VLMs over both CIEM and public datasets.

In this study, we build six models: RoBERTaJIT, CodeBERTJIT, BARTJIT, PLBARTJIT, GPT2JIT, and CodeGPTJIT, each with a distinct pre-trained model as its backbone. We systematically explore the differences and connections between these models. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the models when using Commit code and Commit message as inputs, as well as the relationship between training efficiency and model distribution among these six models. Additionally, we conduct an ablation experiment to explore the sensitivity of each model to inputs. Furthermore, we investigate how the models perform in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our findings indicate that each model based on different backbones shows improvements, and when the backbone's pre-training model is similar, the training resources that need to be consumed are much more closer. We also observe that Commit code plays a significant role in defect detection, and different pre-trained models demonstrate better defect detection ability with a balanced dataset under few-shot scenarios. These results provide new insights for optimizing JIT defect prediction tasks using pre-trained models and highlight the factors that require more attention when constructing such models. Additionally, CodeGPTJIT and GPT2JIT achieved better performance than DeepJIT and CC2Vec on the two datasets respectively under 2000 training samples. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of transformer-based pre-trained models in JIT defect prediction tasks, especially in scenarios with limited training data.

  Zhang",Delta-LoRA: Fine-Tuning High-Rank Parameters with the Delta of Low-Rank Matrices,,,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we present Delta-LoRA, which is a novel parameter-efficient approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). In contrast to LoRA and other low-rank adaptation methods such as AdaLoRA, Delta-LoRA not only updates the low-rank matrices $\bA$ and $\bB$, but also propagate the learning to the pre-trained weights $\bW$ via updates utilizing the delta of the product of two low-rank matrices ($\bA^{(t+1)}\bB^{(t+1)} - \bA^{(t)}\bB^{(t)}$). Such a strategy effectively addresses the limitation that the incremental update of low-rank matrices is inadequate for learning representations capable for downstream tasks. Moreover, as the update of $\bW$ does not need to compute the gradients of $\bW$ and store their momentums, Delta-LoRA shares comparable memory requirements and computational costs with LoRA. Extensive experiments show that Delta-LoRA significantly outperforms existing low-rank adaptation methods. We further support these results with comprehensive analyses that underscore the effectiveness of Delta-LoRA.

Past research on hypothetical induction has a limited setting that (1) the observation annotations of the dataset are not raw web corpus but are manually selected sentences (resulting in a close-domain setting); and (2) the ground truth hypotheses annotations are mostly commonsense knowledge, making the task less challenging. In this work, we propose the first NLP dataset for social science academic hypotheses discovery, consisting of 50 recent papers published in top social science journals. Raw web corpora that are necessary for developing hypotheses in the published papers are also collected in the dataset, with the final goal of creating a system that automatically generates valid, novel, and helpful (to human researchers) hypotheses, given only a pile of raw web corpora. The new dataset can tackle the previous problems because it requires to (1) use raw web corpora as observations; and (2) propose hypotheses even new to humanity. A multi-module framework is developed for the task, as well as three different feedback mechanisms that empirically show performance gain over the base framework. Finally, our framework exhibits high performance in terms of both GPT-4 based evaluation and social science expert evaluation.

However, existing decoding strategies are designed for Natural Language (NL) generation, overlooking the differences between NL and programming languages (PL). Due to this oversight, a better decoding strategy for code generation remains an open question. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study to explore a decoding strategy specialized in code generation. With an analysis of loss distributions of code tokens, we find that code tokens can be divided into two categories: challenging tokens that are difficult to predict and confident tokens that can be easily inferred. Among them, the challenging tokens mainly appear at the beginning of a code block. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a simple yet effective method: Adaptive Temperature (AdapT) sampling, which dynamically adjusts the temperature coefficient when decoding different tokens. We apply a larger temperature when sampling for challenging tokens, allowing LLMs to explore diverse choices. We employ a smaller temperature for confident tokens avoiding the influence of tail randomness noises. We apply AdapT sampling to LLMs with different sizes and conduct evaluations on two popular datasets. Results show that AdapT sampling significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decoding strategy.

However, the responses generated by these models suffer from many problems such as responses not being contextualized and tend to generate generic responses that lack information content, damaging the user's experience seriously. Therefore, many studies try introducing more information into the dialogue models to make the generated responses more vivid and informative. Unlike them, this paper improves the quality of generated responses by learning the implicit pattern information between contexts and responses in the training samples. In this paper, we first build an open-domain dialogue model based on the pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2). And then, an improved scheduled sampling method is proposed for pre-trained models, by which the responses can be used to guide the response generation in the training phase while avoiding the exposure bias problem. More importantly, we design a response-aware mechanism for mining the implicit pattern information between contexts and responses so that the generated replies are more diverse and approximate to human replies. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model (RAD) on the Persona-Chat and DailyDialog datasets; and the experimental results show that our model outperforms the baselines on most automatic and manual metrics.

LLM-integrated frameworks, which serve as the essential infrastructure, have given rise to many LLM-integrated web apps. However, some of these frameworks suffer from Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on apps' servers remotely via prompt injections. Despite the severity of these vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a systematic investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to detect vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-world scenarios.   To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies, including 1) a static analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source code of the framework to detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a prompt-based automated testing approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-integrated web apps. We discovered 13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks, including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the framework developers, resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing 51 apps, we found vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection.

However, the real world is pluralistic, which leads to diversified human preferences with respect to different religions, politics, cultures, etc. Moreover, each individual can have their unique preferences on various topics. Neglecting the diversity of human preferences, current human feedback aligning methods only consider a general reward model, which is below satisfaction for customized or personalized application scenarios. To explore customized preference learning, we collect a domain-specific preference (DSP) dataset, which includes preferred responses for each given query from four practical domains. Besides, from the perspective of data efficiency, we propose a three-stage customized RM learning scheme, then empirically verify its effectiveness on both general preference datasets and our DSP set. Furthermore, we test multiple training and data strategies on the three learning stages. We find several ways to better preserve the general preferring ability while training the customized RMs, especially general preference enrichment, and customized preference imitation learning.

Existing works mainly focus on language and image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video, and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training. During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach, ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate significant language generation quality.

Amount of prompt learning methods have been proposed to efficiently adapt the VLMs to downstream tasks with only a few training samples. We introduce a novel method to improve the prompt learning of vision-language models by incorporating pre-trained large language models (LLMs), called Dual-Aligned Prompt Tuning (DuAl-PT). Learnable prompts, like CoOp, implicitly model the context through end-to-end training, which are difficult to control and interpret. While explicit context descriptions generated by LLMs, like GPT-3, can be directly used for zero-shot classification, such prompts are overly relying on LLMs and still underexplored in few-shot domains. With DuAl-PT, we propose to learn more context-aware prompts, benefiting from both explicit and implicit context modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a pre-trained LLM to generate context descriptions, and we encourage the prompts to learn from the LLM's knowledge by alignment, as well as the alignment between prompts and local image features. Empirically, DuAl-PT achieves superior performance on 11 downstream datasets on few-shot recognition and base-to-new generalization. Hopefully, DuAl-PT can serve as a strong baseline.

Recent studies have explored the use of verbalizer embeddings to reduce labor in this process. However, all existing studies require a tuning process for either the pre-trained models or additional trainable embeddings. Meanwhile, the distance between high-dimensional verbalizer embeddings should not be measured by Euclidean distance due to the potential for non-linear manifolds in the representation space. In this study, we propose a tuning-free manifold-based space re-embedding method called Locally Linear Embedding with Intra-class Neighborhood Constraint (LLE-INC) for verbalizer embeddings, which preserves local properties within the same class as guidance for classification. Experimental results indicate that even without tuning any parameters, our LLE-INC is on par with automated verbalizers with parameter tuning. And with the parameter updating, our approach further enhances prompt-based tuning by up to 3.2%. Furthermore, experiments with the LLaMA-7B&13B indicate that LLE-INC is an efficient tuning-free classification approach for the hyper-scale language models.

Recent studies have focused on constructing Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) data through medical knowledge graphs to enrich the interactive medical knowledge of LLMs. However, the medical literature serving as a rich source of medical knowledge remains unexplored. Our work introduces the CALLA dataset to probe LLMs' interactive knowledge acquisition from Chinese medical literature. It assesses the proficiency of LLMs in mastering medical knowledge through a free-dialogue fact-checking task. We identify a phenomenon called the ``fact-following response``, where LLMs tend to affirm facts mentioned in questions and display a reluctance to challenge them. To eliminate the inaccurate evaluation caused by this phenomenon, for the golden fact, we artificially construct test data from two perspectives: one consistent with the fact and one inconsistent with the fact. Drawing from the probing experiment on the CALLA dataset, we conclude that IFT data highly correlated with the medical literature corpus serves as a potent catalyst for LLMs, enabling themselves to skillfully employ the medical knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase within interactive scenarios, enhancing accuracy. Furthermore, we design a framework for automatically constructing IFT data based on medical literature and discuss some real-world applications.

Due to their sensitivity to privacy concerns, there is a growing demand for their execution directly on mobile devices. Currently, the execution of these generative tasks heavily depends on Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, the limited memory capacity of these devices presents a formidable challenge to the scalability of such models.   In our research, we introduce LLMCad, an innovative on-device inference engine specifically designed for efficient generative Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The core idea behind LLMCad revolves around model collaboration: a compact LLM, residing in memory, takes charge of generating the most straightforward tokens, while a high-precision LLM steps in to validate these tokens and rectify any identified errors. LLMCad incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Instead of generating candidate tokens in a sequential manner, LLMCad employs the smaller LLM to construct a token tree, encompassing a wider range of plausible token pathways. Subsequently, the larger LLM can efficiently validate all of these pathways simultaneously. (2) It employs a self-adjusting fallback strategy, swiftly initiating the verification process whenever the smaller LLM generates an erroneous token. (3) To ensure a continuous flow of token generation, LLMCad speculatively generates tokens during the verification process by implementing a compute-IO pipeline. Through an extensive series of experiments, LLMCad showcases an impressive token generation speed, achieving rates up to 9.3x faster than existing inference engines.

Other LLM evaluation methods are human-based which are costly and time-consuming and are incapable of large-scale evaluation of LLMs. To address the issues above, we propose a novel Deep Interaction-based LLM-evaluation framework. In our proposed framework, LLMs' performances in real-world domains can be evaluated from their deep interaction with other LLMs in elaborately designed evaluation tasks.

In this work, we propose a method with a mixture-of-expert (MOE) controllers to align the text-guided capacity of diffusion models with different kinds of human instructions, enabling our model to handle various open-domain image manipulation tasks with natural language instructions. First, we use large language models (ChatGPT) and conditional image synthesis models (ControlNet) to generate a large number of global image transfer dataset in addition to the instruction-based local image editing dataset. Then, using an MOE technique and task-specific adaptation training on a large-scale dataset, our conditional diffusion model can edit images globally and locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs surprisingly well on various image manipulation tasks when dealing with open-domain images and arbitrary human instructions.

When facing the complicated graph learning tasks, experts have designed diverse Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recent years. They have also implemented AutoML in Graph, also known as AutoGraph, to automatically generate data-specific solutions. Despite their success, they encounter limitations in (1) managing diverse learning tasks at various levels, (2) dealing with different procedures in graph learning beyond architecture design, and (3) the huge requirements on the prior knowledge when using AutoGraph. In this paper, we propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to simplify the learning process on diverse real-world graphs. Specifically, in response to a user request which may contain varying data and learning targets at the node, edge, or graph levels, the complex graph learning task is decomposed into three components following the agent planning, namely, detecting the learning intent, configuring solutions based on AutoGraph, and generating a response. The AutoGraph agents manage crucial procedures in automated graph learning, including data-processing, AutoML configuration, searching architectures, and hyper-parameter fine-tuning. With these agents, those components are processed by decomposing and completing step by step, thereby generating a solution for the given data automatically, regardless of the learning task on node or graph. The proposed method is dubbed Auto$^2$Graph, and the comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks, as well as the human-like decisions made by the agents.

However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM. Such an inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential. In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and language in a unified form. Specifically, we introduce a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read. The resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image. Coped with this tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT can handle both image and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm. This unification empowers LaVIT to serve as an impressive generalist interface to understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously. Extensive experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large margin on massive vision-language tasks.

Recently, the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a simple and training-free semantic parsing paradigm for KBQA: Given a small number of questions and their labeled logical forms as demo examples, LLMs can understand the task intent and generate the logic form for a new question. However, current powerful LLMs have little exposure to logic forms during pre-training, resulting in a high format error rate. To solve this problem, we propose a code-style in-context learning method for KBQA, which converts the generation process of unfamiliar logical form into the more familiar code generation process for LLMs. Experimental results on three mainstream datasets show that our method dramatically mitigated the formatting error problem in generating logic forms while realizing a new SOTA on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQ under the few-shot setting.

The current best practice typically resorts to three approaches: (1) looking for publicly available prototypes; (2) contacting the authors to get a private prototype; and (3) manually implementing a prototype following the description of the publication. However, most published network research does not have public prototypes and private prototypes are hard to get. As such, most reproducing efforts are spent on manual implementation based on the publications, which is both time and labor consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we boldly propose reproducing network research results using the emerging large language models (LLMs). In particular, we first prove its feasibility with a small-scale experiment, in which four students with essential networking knowledge each reproduces a different networking system published in prominent conferences and journals by prompt engineering ChatGPT. We report the experiment's observations and lessons and discuss future open research questions of this proposal. This work raises no ethical issue.

As a simple yet cost-effective workaround, this paper proposes a novel method called EPA (\textbf{E}asy \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}ugmentation)\footnote{While this paper considers augmenting prompts via demonstrations, we name it EPA as the name EDA is already taken by a well-known NLP method \citep{wei-zou-2019-eda}.} that effectively minimizes user efforts in writing demonstrations while improving the model performance at the same time. EPA achieves these goals by automatically augmenting the demonstrations with multiple sources/targets, where each of them paraphrases each other. This is well motivated as augmenting data via paraphrasing effectively improves neural language models. EPA thus employs paraphrasing as an augmentation method for in-context learning. Extensive experiments indicate that EPA effectively improves both NLU and NLG tasks, covering from natural language inference to machine translation in translating tens of languages.\footnote{Code and data will be released upon publication.} ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sat, 9 Sep 2023 09:03:50 GMT'}]",2023-09-12,"[['Lu', 'Hongyuan', ''], ['Lam', 'Wai', '']]",0,0,2023-09-09,1,2,1,0,0,0,2b1738d75e1c10ad3bfb8d9aa041c1c495ec7e2d,261682193.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1738d75e1c10ad3bfb8d9aa041c1c495ec7e2d,arXiv.org,2023.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2156273800', 'name': 'Hongyuan Lu'}, {'authorId': '144594306', 'name': 'Wai Lam'}]",['Chinese University of Hong Kong'],['China'],2023-09

  Junwei Han",Chat2Brain: A Method for Mapping Open-Ended Semantic Queries to Brain Activation Maps,"8 pages, 4 figures",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Over decades, neuroscience has accumulated a wealth of research results in the text modality that can be used to explore cognitive processes. Meta-analysis is a typical method that successfully establishes a link from text queries to brain activation maps using these research results, but it still relies on an ideal query environment. In practical applications, text queries used for meta-analyses may encounter issues such as semantic redundancy and ambiguity, resulting in an inaccurate mapping to brain images. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown great potential in tasks such as context understanding and reasoning, displaying a high degree of consistency with human natural language. Hence, LLMs could improve the connection between text modality and neuroscience, resolving existing challenges of meta-analyses. In this study, we propose a method called Chat2Brain that combines LLMs to basic text-2-image model, known as Text2Brain, to map open-ended semantic queries to brain activation maps in data-scarce and complex query environments. By utilizing the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the performance of the mapping model is optimized by transferring text queries to semantic queries. We demonstrate that Chat2Brain can synthesize anatomically plausible neural activation patterns for more complex tasks of text queries.

Our key contribution is a novel bound for the generalization error of these algorithms with bounded updates, extending beyond the scope of previous works that only focused on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our approach introduces two main novelties: 1) we reformulate the mutual information as the uncertainty of updates, providing a new perspective, and 2) instead of using the chaining rule of mutual information, we employ a variance decomposition technique to decompose information across iterations, allowing for a simpler surrogate process. We analyze our generalization bound under various settings and demonstrate improved bounds when the model dimension increases at the same rate as the number of training data samples. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we also examine the previously observed scaling behavior in large language models. Ultimately, our work takes a further step for developing practical generalization theories.

For the first time, we leverage singular multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to consolidate multiple autonomous driving tasks from videos, i.e., the Risk Object Localization and Intention and Suggestion Prediction (ROLISP) task. ROLISP uses natural language to simultaneously identify and interpret risk objects, understand ego-vehicle intentions, and provide motion suggestions, eliminating the necessity for task-specific architectures. However, lacking high-resolution (HR) information, existing MLLMs often miss small objects (e.g., traffic cones) and overly focus on salient ones (e.g., large trucks) when applied to ROLISP. We propose HiLM-D (Towards High-Resolution Understanding in MLLMs for Autonomous Driving), an efficient method to incorporate HR information into MLLMs for the ROLISP task. Especially, HiLM-D integrates two branches: (i) the low-resolution reasoning branch, can be any MLLMs, processes low-resolution videos to caption risk objects and discern ego-vehicle intentions/suggestions; (ii) the high-resolution perception branch (HR-PB), prominent to HiLM-D,, ingests HR images to enhance detection by capturing vision-specific HR feature maps and prioritizing all potential risks over merely salient objects. Our HR-PB serves as a plug-and-play module, seamlessly fitting into current MLLMs. Experiments on the ROLISP benchmark reveal HiLM-D's notable advantage over leading MLLMs, with improvements of 4.8% in BLEU-4 for captioning and 17.2% in mIoU for detection.

  Zhao, Bing Qin",From Artificially Real to Real: Leveraging Pseudo Data from Large Language Models for Low-Resource Molecule Discovery,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Molecule discovery serves as a cornerstone in numerous scientific domains, fueling the development of new materials and innovative drug designs. Recent developments of in-silico molecule discovery have highlighted the promising results of cross-modal techniques, which bridge molecular structures with their descriptive annotations. However, these cross-modal methods frequently encounter the issue of data scarcity, hampering their performance and application. In this paper, we address the low-resource challenge by utilizing artificially-real data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We first introduce a retrieval-based prompting strategy to construct high-quality pseudo data, then explore the optimal method to effectively leverage this pseudo data. Experiments show that using pseudo data for domain adaptation outperforms all existing methods, while also requiring a smaller model scale, reduced data size and lower training cost, highlighting its efficiency. Furthermore, our method shows a sustained improvement as the volume of pseudo data increases, revealing the great potential of pseudo data in advancing low-resource cross-modal molecule discovery.

However, such hallucination rates could easily be distorted by confounders. Moreover, such hallucination rates could not reflect the reasons for the hallucination, as similar hallucinatory phenomena may originate from different sources. To address these issues, we propose to combine the hallucination level quantification and hallucination reason investigation through an association analysis, which builds the relationship between the hallucination rate of LLMs with a set of risk factors. In this way, we are able to observe the hallucination level under each value of each risk factor, examining the contribution and statistical significance of each risk factor, meanwhile excluding the confounding effect of other factors. Additionally, by recognizing the risk factors according to a taxonomy of model capability, we reveal a set of potential deficiencies in commonsense memorization, relational reasoning, and instruction following, which may further provide guidance for the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning process of LLMs to mitigate the hallucination.

To tackle this issue, we introduce FuzzLLM, an automated fuzzing framework designed to proactively test and discover jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. We utilize templates to capture the structural integrity of a prompt and isolate key features of a jailbreak class as constraints. By integrating different base classes into powerful combo attacks and varying the elements of constraints and prohibited questions, FuzzLLM enables efficient testing with reduced manual effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate FuzzLLM's effectiveness and comprehensiveness in vulnerability discovery across various LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:15:02 GMT'}]",2023-09-12,"[['Yao', 'Dongyu', ''], ['Zhang', 'Jianshu', ''], ['Harris', 'Ian G.', ''], ['Carlsson', 'Marcel', '']]",0,0,2023-09-11,1,4,1,0,0,0,3c784cd3150a359e269c70cfbadd18774d66055d,261681918.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c784cd3150a359e269c70cfbadd18774d66055d,arXiv.org,2023.0,23.0,3.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2238951719', 'name': 'Dongyu Yao'}, {'authorId': '2239054292', 'name': 'Jianshu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2238951230', 'name': 'Ian G.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroLLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter model fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 using over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. Optimized for traditional causal language modeling, AstroLLaMA achieves a 30% lower perplexity than Llama-2, showing marked domain adaptation. Our model generates more insightful and scientifically relevant text completions and embedding extraction than state-of-the-arts foundation models despite having significantly fewer parameters. AstroLLaMA serves as a robust, domain-specific model with broad fine-tuning potential. Its public release aims to spur astronomy-focused research, including automatic paper summarization and conversational agent development.

The fine-tuning of foundation models is a common practice to enhance task performance or align the model's behavior with human expectations, allowing them to gain $speciality$. However, the small datasets used for fine-tuning may not adequately cover the diverse distributions and tasks encountered during pre-training. Consequently, the pursuit of speciality during fine-tuning can lead to a loss of {generality} in the model, which is related to catastrophic forgetting (CF) in deep learning. In this study, we demonstrate this phenomenon in both VLMs and LLMs. For instance, fine-tuning VLMs like CLIP on ImageNet results in a loss of generality in handling diverse distributions, and fine-tuning LLMs like Galactica in the medical domain leads to a loss in following instructions and common sense.   To address the trade-off between the speciality and generality, we investigate multiple regularization methods from continual learning, the weight averaging method (Wise-FT) from out-of-distributional (OOD) generalization, which interpolates parameters between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our findings show that both continual learning and Wise-ft methods effectively mitigate the loss of generality, with Wise-FT exhibiting the strongest performance in balancing speciality and generality.

The predominant focus of research has revolved around developing diverse prompting strategies to guide and structure the reasoning processes of LLMs. However, these approaches based on decoder-only causal language models often operate the input question in a single forward pass, potentially missing the rich, back-and-forth interactions inherent in human reasoning. Scant attention has been paid to a critical dimension, i.e., the input question itself embedded within the prompts. In response, we introduce a deceptively simple yet highly effective prompting strategy, termed question ""re-reading"". Drawing inspiration from human learning and problem-solving, re-reading entails revisiting the question information embedded within input prompts. This approach aligns seamlessly with the cognitive principle of reinforcement, enabling LLMs to extract deeper insights, identify intricate patterns, establish more nuanced connections, and ultimately enhance their reasoning capabilities across various tasks. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning benchmarks serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of our method. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with various language models, though-eliciting prompting methods, and ensemble techniques, further underscoring its versatility and compatibility in the realm of LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Tue, 12 Sep 2023 14:36:23 GMT'}]",2023-09-13,"[['Xu', 'Xiaohan', ''], ['Tao', 'Chongyang', ''], ['Shen', 'Tao', ''], ['Xu', 'Can', ''], ['Xu', 'Hongbo', ''], ['Long', 'Guodong', ''], ['Lou', 'Jian-guang', '']]",0,0,2023-09-12,1,7,1,0,0,0,e7c85d7d58d4b1fde4be8a8f166e46c995dc0f1b,261696483.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7c85d7d58d4b1fde4be8a8f166e46c995dc0f1b,arXiv.org,2023.0,72.0,5.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2188774115', 'name': 'Xiaohan Xu'}, {'authorId': '8801869', 'name': 'Chongyang Tao'}, {'authorId': '143681703', 'name': 'Tao Shen'}, {'authorId': '46747953', 'name': 'Can Xu'}, {'authorId': '2239160918', 'name': 'Hongbo Xu'}, {'authorId': '2062835', 'name': 'Guodong Long'}, {'authorId': '4648762', 'name': 'Jian-Guang Lou'}]",['Institute of Information Engineering'],['China'],2023-09

An intriguing phenomenon in CSE is the significant performance gap between supervised and unsupervised methods, even when their sentence encoder and loss function are the same. Previous works attribute this performance gap to differences in two representation properties (alignment and uniformity). However, alignment and uniformity only measure the results, which means they cannot answer ""What happens during the training process that leads to the performance gap?"" and ""How can the performance gap be narrowed?"". In this paper, we conduct empirical experiments to answer these ""What"" and ""How"" questions. We first answer the ""What"" question by thoroughly comparing the behavior of supervised and unsupervised CSE during their respective training processes. From the comparison, We observe a significant difference in fitting difficulty. Thus, we introduce a metric, called Fitting Difficulty Increment (FDI), to measure the fitting difficulty gap between the evaluation dataset and the held-out training dataset, and use the metric to answer the ""What"" question. Then, based on the insights gained from the ""What"" question, we tackle the ""How"" question by increasing the fitting difficulty of the training dataset. We achieve this by leveraging the In-Context Learning (ICL) capability of the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate data that simulates complex patterns. By utilizing the hierarchical patterns in the LLM-generated data, we effectively narrow the gap between supervised and unsupervised CSE.

How to evaluate the question-solving abilities of LLMs and their degrees of intelligence is a hot-spot but challenging issue. First, the question-solving abilities are interlaced with different ability branches like understanding and massive knowledge categories like mathematics. Second, the inputs of questions are multimodal that may involve text and images. Third, the response format of LLMs is diverse and thus poses great challenges for result extraction and evaluation. In this paper, we propose AGIBench -- a multi-granularity, multimodal, human-referenced, and auto-scoring benchmarking methodology for LLMs. Instead of a collection of blended questions, AGIBench focuses on three typical ability branches and adopts a four-tuple <ability branch, knowledge, difficulty, modal> to label the attributes of each question. First, it supports multi-granularity benchmarking, e.g., per-question, per-ability branch, per-knowledge, per-modal, per-dataset, and per-difficulty level granularities. Second, it contains multimodal input, including text and images. Third, it classifies all the questions into five degrees of difficulty according to the average accuracy rate of abundant educated humans (human-referenced). Fourth, it adopts zero-shot learning to avoid introducing additional unpredictability and provides an auto-scoring method to extract and judge the result. Finally, it defines multi-dimensional metrics, including accuracy under the average, worst, best, and majority voting cases, and repeatability.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted to address tasks demanding in-depth common-sense knowledge, such as reasoning and planning. Recognizing that reward function design is also inherently linked to such knowledge, LLM offers a promising potential in this context. Motivated by this, we propose in this work a novel LLM framework with a self-refinement mechanism for automated reward function design. The framework commences with the LLM formulating an initial reward function based on natural language inputs. Then, the performance of the reward function is assessed, and the results are presented back to the LLM for guiding its self-refinement process. We examine the performance of our proposed framework through a variety of continuous robotic control tasks across three diverse robotic systems. The results indicate that our LLM-designed reward functions are able to rival or even surpass manually designed reward functions, highlighting the efficacy and applicability of our approach.

Consequently, evaluating the safety of LLMs has become an essential task for facilitating the broad applications of LLMs. Nevertheless, the absence of comprehensive safety evaluation benchmarks poses a significant impediment to effectively assess and enhance the safety of LLMs. In this work, we present SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of LLMs, which comprises 11,435 diverse multiple choice questions spanning across 7 distinct categories of safety concerns. Notably, SafetyBench also incorporates both Chinese and English data, facilitating the evaluation in both languages. Our extensive tests over 25 popular Chinese and English LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal a substantial performance advantage for GPT-4 over its counterparts, and there is still significant room for improving the safety of current LLMs. We believe SafetyBench will enable fast and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' safety, and foster the development of safer LLMs. Data and evaluation guidelines are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SafetyBench.

A novel speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average 32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and dialect-specific lexical nuances.

2309.07124,Yuhui Li,"Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Jinjing Zhao, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang",RAIN: Your Language Models Can Align Themselves without Finetuning,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide backward rewind and forward generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates; during the self-evaluation phase, the model receives guidance on which human preference to align with through a fixed-template prompt, eliminating the need to modify the initial prompt. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B over vanilla inference from 82% to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. Under the leading adversarial attack llm-attacks on Vicuna 33B, RAIN establishes a new defense baseline by reducing the attack success rate from 94% to 19%.

However, their textual outputs often require post-processing tasks before they can be practically utilized. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs and Whisper, and focus on integrating multiple ASR text processing tasks related to speech recognition into the ASR model. This integration not only shortens the multi-stage pipeline, but also prevents the propagation of cascading errors, resulting in direct generation of post-processed text. In this study, we focus on ASR-related processing tasks, including Contextual ASR and multiple ASR post processing tasks. To achieve this objective, we introduce the CPPF model, which offers a versatile and highly effective alternative to ASR processing. CPPF seamlessly integrates these tasks without any significant loss in recognition performance.

Inspired by this, we propose PromptASR, a framework that integrates prompts in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) systems to achieve contextualized ASR with controllable style of transcriptions. Specifically, a dedicated text encoder encodes the text prompts and the encodings are injected into the speech encoder by cross-attending the features from two modalities. When using the ground truth text from preceding utterances as content prompt, the proposed system achieves 21.9% and 6.8% relative word error rate reductions on a book reading dataset and an in-house dataset compared to a baseline ASR system. The system can also take word-level biasing lists as prompt to improve recognition accuracy on rare words. An additional style prompt can be given to the text encoder and guide the ASR system to output different styles of transcriptions. The code is available at icefall.

These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords. The empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and chain-of-thought prompting methods.

However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs less effective in downstream vision-language tasks. In this paper, we address the limitation above by 1) introducing MMICL, a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to understand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when faced with extensive textual context.

In order to successfully accomplish the VON task, two essential conditions must be fulfilled:1) the user must know the name of the desired object; and 2) the user-specified object must actually be present within the scene. To meet these conditions, a simulator can incorporate pre-defined object names and positions into the metadata of the scene. However, in real-world scenarios, it is often challenging to ensure that these conditions are always met. Human in an unfamiliar environment may not know which objects are present in the scene, or they may mistakenly specify an object that is not actually present. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, human may still have a demand for an object, which could potentially be fulfilled by other objects present within the scene in an equivalent manner. Hence, we propose Demand-driven Navigation (DDN), which leverages the user's demand as the task instruction and prompts the agent to find the object matches the specified demand. DDN aims to relax the stringent conditions of VON by focusing on fulfilling the user's demand rather than relying solely on predefined object categories or names. We propose a method first acquire textual attribute features of objects by extracting common knowledge from a large language model. These textual attribute features are subsequently aligned with visual attribute features using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP).

This approach is characterized by a two-stage process: drafting and verification. The drafting stage generates draft tokens at a slightly lower quality but more quickly, which is achieved by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers during drafting Subsequently, the verification stage employs the original LLM to validate those draft output tokens in one forward pass. This process ensures the final output remains identical to that produced by the unaltered LLM, thereby maintaining output quality. The proposed method requires no additional neural network training and no extra memory footprint, making it a plug-and-play and cost-effective solution for inference acceleration. Benchmarks with LLaMA-2 and its fine-tuned models demonstrated a speedup up to 1.73$\times$.

2309.08173,Linan Yue,"Linan Yue, Qi Liu, Yichao Du, Weibo Gao, Ye Liu, Fangzhou Yao",FedJudge: Federated Legal Large Language Model,Submitted to ICASSP 2024,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in the field of Legal Intelligence, offering potential applications in assisting legal professionals and laymen. However, the centralized training of these Legal LLMs raises data privacy concerns, as legal data is distributed among various institutions containing sensitive individual information. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring the integration of Legal LLMs with Federated Learning (FL) methodologies. By employing FL, Legal LLMs can be fine-tuned locally on devices or clients, and their parameters are aggregated and distributed on a central server, ensuring data privacy without directly sharing raw data. However, computation and communication overheads hinder the full fine-tuning of LLMs under the FL setting. Moreover, the distribution shift of legal data reduces the effectiveness of FL methods. To this end, in this paper, we propose the first Federated Legal Large Language Model (FedJudge) framework, which fine-tunes Legal LLMs efficiently and effectively. Specifically, FedJudge utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to update only a few additional parameters during the FL training. Besides, we explore the continual learning methods to preserve the global model's important parameters when training local clients to mitigate the problem of data shifts. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of FedJudge. Code is released at https://github.com/yuelinan/FedJudge.

We collect and annotate the first physics word problem dataset-PhysQA, which contains over 1000 junior high school physics word problems (covering Kinematics, Mass&Density, Mechanics, Heat, Electricity). Then we use OpenAI' s GPT3.5 to generate the answer of these problems and found that GPT3.5 could automatically solve 49.3% of the problems through zero-shot learning and 73.2% through few-shot learning. This result demonstrates that by using similar problems and their answers as prompt, LLM could solve elementary physics word problems approaching human level performance. In addition to solving problems, GPT3.5 can also summarize the knowledge or topics covered by the problems, provide relevant explanations, and generate new physics word problems based on the input. Our work is the first research to focus on the automatic solving, explanation, and generation of physics word problems across various types and scenarios, and we achieve an acceptable and state-of-the-art accuracy.

Recently, ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model, has demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, suggesting its potential to automate code review processes. However, it is still unclear how well ChatGPT performs in code review tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to understand the capabilities of ChatGPT in code review tasks, specifically focusing on automated code refinement based on given code reviews. To conduct the study, we select the existing benchmark CodeReview and construct a new code review dataset with high quality. We use CodeReviewer, a state-of-the-art code review tool, as a baseline for comparison with ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT outperforms CodeReviewer in code refinement tasks. Specifically, our results show that ChatGPT achieves higher EM and BLEU scores of 22.78 and 76.44 respectively, while the state-of-the-art method achieves only 15.50 and 62.88 on a high-quality code review dataset. We further identify the root causes for ChatGPT's underperformance and propose several strategies to mitigate these challenges.

In the context of Traditional Chinese, there is a scarcity of comprehensive and diverse benchmarks to evaluate the capabilities of language models, despite the existence of certain benchmarks such as DRCD, TTQA, CMDQA, and FGC dataset. To address this gap, we propose a novel set of benchmarks that leverage existing English datasets and are tailored to evaluate language models in Traditional Chinese.

The proposed benchmarks offer a comprehensive evaluation framework, enabling the assessment of language models' capabilities across different tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, Taiwan-LLaMa-v1.0, and Model 7-C, our proprietary model, on these benchmarks. The evaluation results highlight that our model, Model 7-C, achieves performance comparable to GPT-3.5 with respect to a part of the evaluated capabilities.

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 9 datasets spanning language understanding and generation tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation by up to 25% and 14% respectively. Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.

However, in order to remain up-to-date and align with human instructions, LLMs inevitably require external knowledge during their interactions with users. This raises a crucial question: How will LLMs respond when external knowledge interferes with their parametric knowledge? To investigate this question, we propose a framework that systematically elicits LLM parametric knowledge and introduces external knowledge. Specifically, we uncover the impacts by constructing a parametric knowledge graph to reveal the different knowledge structures of LLMs, and introduce external knowledge through distractors of varying degrees, methods, positions, and formats. Our experiments on both black-box and open-source models demonstrate that LLMs tend to produce responses that deviate from their parametric knowledge, particularly when they encounter direct conflicts or confounding changes of information within detailed contexts. We also find that while LLMs are sensitive to the veracity of external knowledge, they can still be distracted by unrelated information. These findings highlight the risk of hallucination when integrating external knowledge, even indirectly, during interactions with current LLMs. All the data and results are publicly available.

However, most of the previous studies neglect the multi-lingual nature of some main-stream LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT and GPT-4), and typically focus on monolingual scenarios, where LLMs are edited and evaluated in the same language. As a result, it is still unknown the effect of source language editing on a different target language. In this paper, we aim to figure out this cross-lingual effect in knowledge editing. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale cross-lingual synthetic dataset by translating ZsRE from English to Chinese. Then, we conduct English editing on various knowledge editing methods covering different paradigms, and evaluate their performance in Chinese, and vice versa. To give deeper analyses of the cross-lingual effect, the evaluation includes four aspects, i.e., reliability, generality, locality and portability. Furthermore, we analyze the inconsistent behaviors of the edited models and discuss their specific challenges.

While these models excel at understanding and generating human-like text, their widespread deployment can be prohibitively expensive. SortedNet is a recent training technique for enabling dynamic inference for deep neural networks. It leverages network modularity to create sub-models with varying computational loads, sorting them based on computation/accuracy characteristics in a nested manner. We extend SortedNet to generative NLP tasks, making large language models dynamic without any pretraining and by only replacing standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) at the same costs. Our approach boosts model efficiency, eliminating the need for multiple models for various scenarios during inference. We show that using this approach, we are able to unlock the potential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target output. Our sub-models remain integral components of the original model, minimizing storage requirements and transition costs between different computational/latency budgets. By applying this approach on LLaMa 2 13B for tuning on the Stanford Alpaca dataset and comparing it to normal tuning and early exit via PandaLM benchmark, we show that Sorted Fine-Tuning can deliver models twice as fast as the original model while maintaining or exceeding performance.

The techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown remarkable capabilities for various tasks, including named entity recognition, machine translation and dialogue systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant improvements across various NLP downstream tasks. However, there is a lack of specialized LLMs for IT operations. In this paper, we introduce the OWL, a large language model trained on our collected OWL-Instruct dataset with a wide range of IT-related information, where the mixture-of-adapter strategy is proposed to improve the parameter-efficient tuning across different domains or tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our OWL on the OWL-Bench established by us and open IT-related benchmarks. OWL demonstrates superior performance results on IT tasks, which outperforms existing models by significant margins. Moreover, we hope that the findings of our work will provide more insights to revolutionize the techniques of IT operations with specialized LLMs. ","[{'version': 'v1', 'created': 'Sun, 17 Sep 2023 15:19:29 GMT'}]",2023-09-19,"[['Guo', 'Hongcheng', ''], ['Yang', 'Jian', ''], ['Liu', 'Jiaheng', ''], ['Yang', 'Liqun', ''], ['Chai', 'Linzheng', ''], ['Bai', 'Jiaqi', ''], ['Peng', 'Junran', ''], ['Hu', 'Xiaorong', ''], ['Chen', 'Chao', ''], ['Zhang', 'Dongfeng', ''], ['Shi', 'Xu', ''], ['Zheng', 'Tieqiao', ''], ['Zheng', 'Liangfan', ''], ['Zhang', 'Bo', ''], ['Xu', 'Ke', ''], ['Li', 'Zhoujun', '']]",0,0,2023-09-17,1,16,1,0,0,0,62b4e06f5249d22e4a153ec4a2dc934c6a014372,262043747.0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62b4e06f5249d22e4a153ec4a2dc934c6a014372,arXiv.org,2023.0,73.0,1.0,0.0,True,['Computer Science'],"[{'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]","[{'authorId': '2234806', 'name': 'Hongcheng Guo'}, {'authorId': '37081450', 'name': 'Jian Yang'}, {'authorId': '2108421213', 'name': 'Jiaheng Liu'}, {'authorId': '46554649', 'name': 'Liqun Yang'}, {'authorId': '2165382882', 'name': 'Linzheng Chai'}, {'authorId': '2107018151', 'name': 'Jiaqi Bai'}, {'authorId': '2243329942', 'name': 'Junran Peng'}, {'authorId': '2243804125', 'name': 'Xiaorong Hu'}, {'authorId': '2244169322', 'name': 'Chao Chen'}, {'authorId': '2243794847', 'name': 'Dongfeng Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2243024470', 'name': 'Xu Shi'}, {'authorId': '2152309872', 'name': 'Tieqiao Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2182735047', 'name': 'Liangfan Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2243445798', 'name': 'Bo Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2117101322', 'name': 'Ke Xu'}, {'authorId': '2144279674', 'name': 'Zhoujun Li'}]","['Beihang University', 'Cloudwise Research']",['China'],2023-09

This paper introduces an innovative progressive synthesis and editing operation that systematically incorporates entities into the target image, ensuring their adherence to spatial and relational constraints at each sequential step. Our key insight stems from the observation that while a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model adeptly handles one or two entities, it often falters when dealing with a greater number. To address this limitation, we propose harnessing the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose intricate and protracted text descriptions into coherent directives adhering to stringent formats. To facilitate the execution of directives involving distinct semantic operations-namely insertion, editing, and erasing-we formulate the Stimulus, Response, and Fusion (SRF) framework. Within this framework, latent regions are gently stimulated in alignment with each operation, followed by the fusion of the responsive latent components to achieve cohesive entity manipulation. Our proposed framework yields notable advancements in object synthesis, particularly when confronted with intricate and lengthy textual inputs. Consequently, it establishes a new benchmark for text-to-image generation tasks, further elevating the field's performance standards.

At present, most model compression for LLMs requires manual design of pruning features, which has problems such as complex optimization pipeline and difficulty in retaining the capabilities of certain parts of the model.Therefore, we propose a novel pruning approach: firstly, a training set of a certain number of architecture-accuracy pairs is established, and then a non-neural model is trained as an accuracy predictor. Using the accuracy predictor to further optimize the search space and search, the optimal model can be automatically selected. Experiments show that our proposed approach is effective and efficient.

However, existing research has rarely paid attention to this issue. And accurately classifying these propositions is crucial for natural language understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we put forward the concepts of explicit and implicit propositions and propose a comprehensive multi-level proposition classification system based on linguistics and logic. Correspondingly, we create a large-scale Chinese proposition dataset PEACE from multiple domains, covering all categories related to propositions. To evaluate the Chinese proposition classification ability of existing models and explore their limitations, We conduct evaluations on PEACE using several different methods including the Rule-based method, SVM, BERT, RoBERTA, and ChatGPT. Results show the importance of properly modeling the semantic features of propositions. BERT has relatively good proposition classification capability, but lacks cross-domain transferability. ChatGPT performs poorly, but its classification ability can be improved by providing more proposition information. Many issues are still far from being resolved and require further study.

  https://github.com/qiuhuachuan/CensorChat",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content, in the context of a dialogue, can have severe side effects on users in open-domain dialogue systems. However, research on detecting NSFW language, especially sexually explicit content, within a dialogue context has significantly lagged behind. To address this issue, we introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at NSFW dialogue detection. Leveraging knowledge distillation techniques involving GPT-4 and ChatGPT, this dataset offers a cost-effective means of constructing NSFW content detectors. The process entails collecting real-life human-machine interaction data and breaking it down into single utterances and single-turn dialogues, with the chatbot delivering the final utterance. ChatGPT is employed to annotate unlabeled data, serving as a training set. Rationale validation and test sets are constructed using ChatGPT and GPT-4 as annotators, with a self-criticism strategy for resolving discrepancies in labeling. A BERT model is fine-tuned as a text classifier on pseudo-labeled data, and its performance is assessed. The study emphasizes the importance of AI systems prioritizing user safety and well-being in digital conversations while respecting freedom of expression. The proposed approach not only advances NSFW content detection but also aligns with evolving user protection needs in AI-driven dialogues.

To increase its practicality, the performance of VisualProg on specific tasks needs to be improved. However, the non-differentiability of VisualProg limits the possibility of employing the fine-tuning strategy on specific tasks to achieve further improvements. In our analysis, we discovered that significant performance issues in VisualProg's execution originated from errors made by the sub-modules at corresponding visual sub-task steps. To address this, we propose ``VisualProg Distiller"", a method of supplementing and distilling process knowledge to optimize the performance of each VisualProg sub-module on decoupled visual sub-tasks, thus enhancing the overall task performance. Specifically, we choose an end-to-end model that is well-performed on the given task as the teacher and further distill the knowledge of the teacher into the invoked visual sub-modules step-by-step based on the execution flow of the VisualProg-generated programs. In this way, our method is capable of facilitating the fine-tuning of the non-differentiable VisualProg frameworks effectively. Extensive and comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can achieve a substantial performance improvement of VisualProg, and outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Furthermore, to provide valuable process supervision for the GQA task, we construct a large-scale dataset by utilizing the distillation process of our method.

To harness this transformation, we need to understand the limitations of LLMs. Here, we investigate the bias of AIGC produced by seven representative LLMs, including ChatGPT and LLaMA. We collect news articles from The New York Times and Reuters, both known for their dedication to provide unbiased news. We then apply each examined LLM to generate news content with headlines of these news articles as prompts, and evaluate the gender and racial biases of the AIGC produced by the LLM by comparing the AIGC and the original news articles. We further analyze the gender bias of each LLM under biased prompts by adding gender-biased messages to prompts constructed from these news headlines. Our study reveals that the AIGC produced by each examined LLM demonstrates substantial gender and racial biases. Moreover, the AIGC generated by each LLM exhibits notable discrimination against females and individuals of the Black race. Among the LLMs, the AIGC generated by ChatGPT demonstrates the lowest level of bias, and ChatGPT is the sole model capable of declining content generation when provided with biased prompts.

  International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2023)",,,,cs.CR cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Auto-completing code enables developers to speed up coding significantly. Recent advances in transformer-based large language model (LLM) technologies have been applied to code synthesis. However, studies show that many of such synthesized codes contain vulnerabilities. We propose a novel vulnerability-constrained decoding approach to reduce the amount of vulnerable code generated by such models. Using a small dataset of labeled vulnerable lines of code, we fine-tune an LLM to include vulnerability labels when generating code, acting as an embedded classifier. Then, during decoding, we deny the model to generate these labels to avoid generating vulnerable code. To evaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SC security. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397 Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuning took more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tuned model could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs were vulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containing different types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found that more than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we further fine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types of vulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuning took only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again and found that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated as vulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach could efficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.

Our experimental analysis on public and proprietary datasets reveals that the proposed methods not only increase stability in RLHF training but also achieve higher reward scores and win rates.

Under review,,,,cs.AI cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Learnersourcing involves students generating and sharing learning resources with their peers. When learnersourcing multiple-choice questions, creating explanations for the generated questions is a crucial step as it facilitates a deeper understanding of the related concepts. However, it is often difficult for students to craft effective explanations due to limited subject understanding and a tendency to merely restate the question stem, distractors, and correct answer. To help scaffold this task, in this work we propose a self-reinforcement large-language-model framework, with the goal of generating and evaluating explanations automatically. Comprising three modules, the framework generates student-aligned explanations, evaluates these explanations to ensure their quality and iteratively enhances the explanations. If an explanation's evaluation score falls below a defined threshold, the framework iteratively refines and reassesses the explanation. Importantly, our framework emulates the manner in which students compose explanations at the relevant grade level. For evaluation, we had a human subject-matter expert compare the explanations generated by students with the explanations created by the open-source large language model Vicuna-13B, a version of Vicuna-13B that had been fine-tuned using our method, and by GPT-4. We observed that, when compared to other large language models, GPT-4 exhibited a higher level of creativity in generating explanations. We also found that explanations generated by GPT-4 were ranked higher by the human expert than both those created by the other models and the original student-created explanations. Our findings represent a significant advancement in enriching the learnersourcing experience for students and enhancing the capabilities of large language models in educational applications.

However, these approaches often require significant architectural or decoding modifications, making them challenging to apply to additional constraints or resolve different constraint combinations. To address this, our paper introduces Regular Expression Instruction (REI), which utilizes an instruction-based mechanism to fully exploit regular expressions' advantages to uniformly model diverse constraints. Specifically, our REI supports all popular fine-grained controllable generation constraints, i.e., lexical, positional, and length, as well as their complex combinations, via regular expression-style instructions.

However, current evaluation paradigms often focus solely on benchmark performance with single-turn exchanges, neglecting the intricate interactions among the user, LLMs, and external tools, creating a discrepancy between benchmark evaluation and real-world use cases. We introduce MINT benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn interactions by (1) using tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback. To ensure reproducibility, we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can access tools by executing Python code and receive natural language feedback from the user simulated with GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established datasets and tasks focusing on reasoning, coding, and decision-making and carefully curate them into a compact subset of instances for efficient evaluation. Our analysis of 20 open- and closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (1) LLMs generally benefit from tool interactions and language feedback, with performance gains (absolute, same below) of 1--8% per additional turn with tool use and 2--17% with natural language feedback. (2) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better multi-turn performance. (3) Surprisingly, on LLMs we evaluated, we found supervised instruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We hope MINT can help measure progress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn interactions, especially for open-source communities where multi-turn human evaluation has been less accessible compared to commercial LLMs with a larger user base.

  Huang",Making Small Language Models Better Multi-task Learners with Mixture-of-Task-Adapters,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved amazing zero-shot learning performance over a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, especially for text generative tasks. Yet, the large size of LLMs often leads to the high computational cost of model training and online deployment. In our work, we present ALTER, a system that effectively builds the multi-tAsk Learners with mixTure-of-task-adaptERs upon small language models (with <1B parameters) to address multiple NLP tasks simultaneously, capturing the commonalities and differences between tasks, in order to support domain-specific applications. Specifically, in ALTER, we propose the Mixture-of-Task-Adapters (MTA) module as an extension to the transformer architecture for the underlying model to capture the intra-task and inter-task knowledge. A two-stage training method is further proposed to optimize the collaboration between adapters at a small computational cost. Experimental results over a mixture of NLP tasks show that our proposed MTA architecture and the two-stage training method achieve good performance. Based on ALTER, we have also produced MTA-equipped language models for various domains.

This process is crucial for various genomic analyses, including variant calling, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Conventional methods, refined over decades, tackle this challenge in two steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likely positions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLM) in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric captures semantic similarity, recent efforts have explored whether the same Transformer architecture can produce numerical representations for DNA sequences. Such models have shown early promise in tasks involving classification of short DNA sequences, such as the detection of coding vs non-coding regions, as well as the identification of enhancer and promoter sequences. Performance at sequence classification tasks does not, however, translate to sequence alignment, where it is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to successfully align every read. We address this open problem by framing it as an Embed-Search-Align task. In this framework, a novel encoder model DNA-ESA generates representations of reads and fragments of the reference, which are projected into a shared vector space where the read-fragment distance is used as surrogate for alignment. In particular, DNA-ESA introduces: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervised training of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich sequence-level embeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on a global scale. DNA-ESA is >97% accurate when aligning 250-length reads onto a human reference genome of 3 gigabases (single-haploid), far exceeds the performance of 6 recent DNA-Transformer model baselines and shows task transfer across chromosomes and species.

In addition to the pursuit of better performance and the avoidance of violent feedback on a certain prompt, to ensure the responsibility of the LLM, much attention is drawn to the robustness of LLMs. However, existing evaluation methods mostly rely on traditional question answering datasets with predefined supervised labels, which do not align with the superior generation capabilities of contemporary LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel rational evaluation approach that leverages pre-trained reward models as diagnostic tools to evaluate the longer conversation generated from more challenging open questions by LLMs, which we refer to as the Reward Model for Reasonable Robustness Evaluation (TREvaL). Longer conversations manifest the comprehensive grasp of language models in terms of their proficiency in understanding questions, a capability not entirely encompassed by individual words or letters, which may exhibit oversimplification and inherent biases. Our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that TREvaL provides an innovative method for evaluating the robustness of an LLM. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that LLMs frequently exhibit vulnerability to word-level perturbations that are commonplace in daily language usage. Notably, we are surprised to discover that robustness tends to decrease as fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF) is conducted. The code of TREval is available in https://github.com/Harry-mic/TREvaL.

In this paper, we study the KG-augmented language model approach for solving the knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) task that requires rich world knowledge. Existing work has shown that retrieving KG knowledge to enhance LLMs prompting can significantly improve LLMs performance in KGQA. However, their approaches lack a well-formed verbalization of KG knowledge, i.e., they ignore the gap between KG representations and textual representations. To this end, we propose an answer-sensitive KG-to-Text approach that can transform KG knowledge into well-textualized statements most informative for KGQA. Based on this approach, we propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task. Experiments on several KGQA benchmarks show that the proposed KG-to-Text augmented LLMs approach outperforms previous KG-augmented LLMs approaches regarding answer accuracy and usefulness of knowledge statements.

Recent developments have incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to align these models with human goals. However, SFT methods treat all training data with mixed quality equally, while RLFT methods require high-quality pairwise or ranking-based preference data. In this study, we present a novel framework, named OpenChat, to advance open-source language models with mixed-quality data. Specifically, we consider the general SFT training data, consisting of a small amount of expert data mixed with a large proportion of sub-optimal data, without any preference labels. We propose the C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained reward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary data quality information. Interestingly, the optimal policy in C-RLFT can be easily solved through single-stage, RL-free supervised learning, which is lightweight and avoids costly human preference labeling. Through extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, our openchat-13b fine-tuned with C-RLFT achieves the highest average performance among all 13b open-source language models. Moreover, we use AGIEval to validate the model generalization performance, in which only openchat-13b surpasses the base model. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to shed light on the effectiveness and robustness of OpenChat. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat.

Current chart-related tasks focus on either chart perception which refers to extracting information from the visual charts, or performing reasoning given the extracted data, e.g. in a tabular form. In this paper, we aim to establish a unified and label-efficient learning paradigm for joint perception and reasoning tasks, which can be generally applicable to different downstream tasks, beyond the question-answering task as specifically studied in peer works. Specifically, StructChart first reformulates the chart information from the popular tubular form (specifically linearized CSV) to the proposed Structured Triplet Representations (STR), which is more friendly for reducing the task gap between chart perception and reasoning due to the employed structured information extraction for charts. We then propose a Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) to quantitatively evaluate the performance for the chart perception task. To enrich the dataset for training, we further explore the possibility of leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing the chart diversity in terms of both chart visual style and its statistical information. Extensive experiments are conducted on various chart-related tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and promising potential for a unified chart perception-reasoning paradigm to push the frontier of chart understanding.

Recent studies have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the input-output requirement of LLMs, existing approaches are developed under a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we introduce Auto-UI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique -- leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans -- to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30K unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 90% and an overall action success rate of 74%.

Given a goal described in natural language, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2, MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%.

However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs, the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26% attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also vulnerable.

In this study, we propose a novel approach, namely   InstructERC, to reformulates the ERC task from a discriminative framework to a generative framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) . InstructERC has two significant contributions: Firstly, InstructERC introduces a simple yet effective retrieval template module, which helps the model explicitly integrate multi-granularity dialogue supervision information by concatenating the historical dialog content, label statement, and emotional domain demonstrations with high semantic similarity. Furthermore, we introduce two additional emotion alignment tasks, namely speaker identification and emotion prediction tasks, to implicitly model the dialogue role relationships and future emotional tendencies in conversations.

While there is currently no existing large language model for Tibetan due to its low-resource nature, that day will undoubtedly arrive. Therefore, research on efficient fine-tuning for low-resource language models like Tibetan is highly necessary. Our research can serve as a reference to fill this crucial gap. Efficient fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained language models (PLMs) in Tibetan have seen minimal exploration. We conducted three types of efficient fine-tuning experiments on the publicly available TNCC-title dataset: ""prompt-tuning,"" ""Adapter lightweight fine-tuning,"" and ""prompt-tuning + Adapter fine-tuning.""

Work in progress",,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Detecting fake news requires both a delicate sense of diverse clues and a profound understanding of the real-world background, which remains challenging for detectors based on small language models (SLMs) due to their knowledge and capability limitations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an empirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could generally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales but still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis attributes such a gap to the LLM's inability to select and integrate rationales properly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may not substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor for SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate this proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news detection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis from the LLMs' rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by distillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without inquiring LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and ARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based, LLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.

Among these tasks, Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) stands as a widely discussed category, necessitating seamless integration between LLMs and the retrieval of external knowledge. Existing methods employ LLM to generate reasoning paths and plans, and utilize IR to iteratively retrieve related knowledge, but these approaches have inherent flaws. On one hand, Information Retriever (IR) is hindered by the low quality of generated queries by LLM. On the other hand, LLM is easily misguided by the irrelevant knowledge by IR. These inaccuracies, accumulated by the iterative interaction between IR and LLM, lead to a disaster in effectiveness at the end. To overcome above barriers, in this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for MHQA called Furthest-Reasoning-with-Plan-Assessment (FuRePA), including an improved framework (Furthest Reasoning) and an attached module (Plan Assessor). 1) Furthest reasoning operates by masking previous reasoning path and generated queries for LLM, encouraging LLM generating chain of thought from scratch in each iteration.

  Ga\v{s}i\'c",Affect Recognition in Conversations Using Large Language Models,,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Affect recognition, encompassing emotions, moods, and feelings, plays a pivotal role in human communication. In the realm of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), the ability to discern and respond to human affective cues is a critical factor for creating engaging and empathetic interactions. This study delves into the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to recognise human affect in conversations, with a focus on both open-domain chit-chat dialogues and task-oriented dialogues. Leveraging three diverse datasets, namely IEMOCAP, EmoWOZ, and DAIC-WOZ, covering a spectrum of dialogues from casual conversations to clinical interviews, we evaluated and compared LLMs' performance in affect recognition. Our investigation explores the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of LLMs through in-context learning (ICL) as well as their model capacities through task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, this study takes into account the potential impact of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors on LLM predictions. With this work, we aim to shed light on the extent to which LLMs can replicate human-like affect recognition capabilities in conversations.

In safety-critical areas, the construction of assurance cases is indispensable. Trustworthiness Derivation Trees (TDTs) enhance assurance cases by incorporating formal methods, rendering it possible for automatic reasoning about assurance cases. We present Trustworthiness Derivation Tree Analyzer (Trusta), a desktop application designed to automatically construct and verify TDTs. The tool has a built-in Prolog interpreter in its backend, and is supported by the constraint solvers Z3 and MONA. Therefore, it can solve constraints about logical formulas involving arithmetic, sets, Horn clauses etc. Trusta also utilizes large language models to make the creation and evaluation of assurance cases more convenient. It allows for interactive human examination and modification. We evaluated top language models like ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and PaLM 2 for generating assurance cases. Our tests showed a 50%-80% similarity between machine-generated and human-created cases. In addition, Trusta can extract formal constraints from text in natural languages, facilitating an easier interpretation and validation process. This extraction is subject to human review and correction, blending the best of automated efficiency with human insight. To our knowledge, this marks the first integration of large language models in automatic creating and reasoning about assurance cases, bringing a novel approach to a traditional challenge. Through several industrial case studies, Trusta has proven to quickly find some subtle issues that are typically missed in manual inspection, demonstrating its practical value in enhancing the assurance case development process.

Traditional fine-tuning approaches can be resource-intensive and potentially compromise a model's generalization capacity. Furthermore, state-of-the-art language models like GPT-3.5 and Claude are primarily accessible through API calls, which makes fine-tuning models challenging. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the outputs of large models for tailored tasks and semi-automatically developed a set of novel prompts from several perspectives, including task-relevance, supportive evidence generation (e.g. chain-of-thought and knowledge), diverse path decoding to aid the model. Experimental results on ProtoQA dataset demonstrate that with better designed prompts we can achieve the new state-of-art(SOTA) on the ProtoQA leaderboard, improving the Max Answer@1 score by 8%, Max Incorrect@1 score by 4% (breakthrough 50% for the first time) compared to the previous SOTA model and achieved an improvement on StrategyQA and CommonsenseQA2.0 (3% and 1%, respectively). Furthermore, with the generated Chain-of-Thought and knowledge, we can improve the interpretability of the model while also surpassing the previous SOTA models. We hope that our work can provide insight for the NLP community to develop better prompts and explore the potential of large language models for more complex reasoning tasks.

With the fast growth of LLM-enabled AI applications and democratization of open-souced LLMs, fine-tuning has become possible for non-expert individuals, but intensively performed LLM fine-tuning worldwide could result in significantly high energy consumption and carbon footprint, which may bring large environmental impact. Mitigating such environmental impact towards Green AI directly correlates to reducing the FLOPs of fine-tuning, but existing techniques on efficient LLM fine-tuning can only achieve limited reduction of such FLOPs, due to their ignorance of the backpropagation cost in fine-tuning. To address this limitation, in this paper we present GreenTrainer, a new LLM fine-tuning technique that adaptively evaluates different tensors' backpropagation costs and contributions to the fine-tuned model accuracy, to minimize the fine-tuning cost by selecting the most appropriate set of tensors in training. Such selection in GreenTrainer is made based on a given objective of FLOPs reduction, which can flexibly adapt to the carbon footprint in energy supply and the need in Green AI. Experiment results over multiple open-sourced LLM models and abstractive summarization datasets show that, compared to fine-tuning the whole LLM model, GreenTrainer can save up to 64% FLOPs in fine-tuning without any noticeable model accuracy loss. Compared to the existing fine-tuning techniques such as LoRa, GreenTrainer can achieve up to 4% improvement on model accuracy with on-par FLOPs reduction.

However, hindered by the closed-source or high computational demand to host and tune, there is a lack of practice to further calibrate an off-the-shelf LLM-based evaluator towards better human alignment. In this work, we propose AutoCalibrate, a multi-stage, gradient-free approach to automatically calibrate and align an LLM-based evaluator toward human preference. Instead of explicitly modeling human preferences, we first implicitly encompass them within a set of human labels. Then, an initial set of scoring criteria is drafted by the language model itself, leveraging in-context learning on different few-shot examples. To further calibrate this set of criteria, we select the best performers and re-draft them with self-refinement. Our experiments on multiple text quality evaluation datasets illustrate a significant improvement in correlation with expert evaluation through calibration. Our comprehensive qualitative analysis conveys insightful intuitions and observations on the essence of effective scoring criteria.

Test script generation is a vital component of software testing, enabling efficient and reliable automation of repetitive test tasks. However, existing generation approaches often encounter limitations, such as difficulties in accurately capturing and reproducing test scripts across diverse devices, platforms, and applications. These challenges arise due to differences in screen sizes, input modalities, platform behaviors, API inconsistencies, and application architectures. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for achieving robust and comprehensive test automation.   By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, we aim to address these challenges and explore its potential as a versatile tool for test automation. We investigate how well LLMs can adapt to diverse devices and systems while accurately capturing and generating test scripts. Additionally, we evaluate its cross-platform generation capabilities by assessing its ability to handle operating system variations and platform-specific behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the application of LLMs in cross-app migration, where it generates test scripts across different applications and software environments based on existing scripts.   Throughout the investigation, we analyze its adaptability to various user interfaces, app architectures, and interaction patterns, ensuring accurate script generation and compatibility.

  Watanabe",Reproducing Whisper-Style Training Using an Open-Source Toolkit and Publicly Available Data,Accepted at ASRU 2023,,,,cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Pre-training speech models on large volumes of data has achieved remarkable success. OpenAI Whisper is a multilingual multitask model trained on 680k hours of supervised speech data. It generalizes well to various speech recognition and translation benchmarks even in a zero-shot setup. However, the full pipeline for developing such models (from data collection to training) is not publicly accessible, which makes it difficult for researchers to further improve its performance and address training-related issues such as efficiency, robustness, fairness, and bias. This work presents an Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM), which reproduces Whisper-style training using an open-source toolkit and publicly available data. OWSM even supports more translation directions and can be more efficient to train. We will publicly release all scripts used for data preparation, training, inference, and scoring as well as pre-trained models and training logs to promote open science.

However, the use of in-the-wild large-scale speech data in the speech technology community remains constrained. One reason for this limitation is that a considerable amount of the publicly available speech data is compromised by background noise, speech overlapping, lack of speech segmentation information, missing speaker labels, and incomplete transcriptions, which can largely hinder their usefulness. On the other hand, human annotation of speech data is both time-consuming and costly. To address this issue, we introduce an automatic in-the-wild speech data preprocessing framework (AutoPrep) in this paper, which is designed to enhance speech quality, generate speaker labels, and produce transcriptions automatically. The proposed AutoPrep framework comprises six components: speech enhancement, speech segmentation, speaker clustering, target speech extraction, quality filtering and automatic speech recognition. Experiments conducted on the open-sourced WenetSpeech and our self-collected AutoPrepWild corpora demonstrate that the proposed AutoPrep framework can generate preprocessed data with similar DNSMOS and PDNSMOS scores compared to several open-sourced TTS datasets. The corresponding TTS system can achieve up to 0.68 in-domain speaker similarity.

This paper presents a comparative study of three commonly used structures as connectors, including fully connected layers, multi-head cross-attention, and Q-Former. Speech encoders from the Whisper model series as well as LLMs from the Vicuna model series with different model sizes were studied. Experiments were performed on the commonly used LibriSpeech, Common Voice, and GigaSpeech datasets, where the LLMs with Q-Formers demonstrated consistent and considerable word error rate (WER) reductions over LLMs with other connector structures. Q-Former-based LLMs can generalise well to out-of-domain datasets, where 12% relative WER reductions over the Whisper baseline ASR model were achieved on the Eval2000 test set without using any in-domain training data from Switchboard. Moreover, a novel segment-level Q-Former is proposed to enable LLMs to recognise speech segments with a duration exceeding the limitation of the encoders, which results in 17% relative WER reductions over other connector structures on 90-second-long speech data.

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on low-level visual perception and understanding. To address this gap, we present Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. a) To evaluate the low-level perception ability, we construct the LLVisionQA dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examine the description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the LLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise, indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. Project Page: https://vqassessment.github.io/Q-Bench.

As the adoption of LLMs becomes more widespread in software coding ecosystems, a pressing issue has emerged: does the generated code contain social biases, such as those related to age, gender, and race? This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and ethical foundation of software applications that depend on the code generated by these models, yet is under-explored in the literature. This paper presents a novel bias assessment framework that is specifically designed for code generation tasks. Based on this framework, we conduct an extensive evaluation on the bias of nine state-of-the-art LLM-based code generation models. Our findings reveal that first, 31.45\% to 79.93\% code functions generated by our evaluated code generation models are biased, and 9.68\% to 37.37\% code functions' functionality are affected by the bias, which means biases not only exist in code generation models but in some cases, directly affect the functionality of the generated code, posing risks of unintended and possibly harmful software behaviors. To mitigate bias from code generation models, we propose three mitigation strategies, which can decrease the biased code ratio to a very low level of 0.4\% to 4.57\%.

Nevertheless, existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models are primarily trained on concrete physical objects and tend to fail to visualize abstract concepts. Inspired by the three-layer artwork theory that identifies critical factors, intent, object and form during artistic creation, we propose a framework of Text-to-Image generation for Abstract Concepts (TIAC). The abstract concept is clarified into a clear intent with a detailed definition to avoid ambiguity. LLMs then transform it into semantic-related physical objects, and the concept-dependent form is retrieved from an LLM-extracted form pattern set. Information from these three aspects will be integrated to generate prompts for T2I models via LLM. Evaluation results from human assessments and our newly designed metric concept score demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in creating images that can sufficiently express abstract concepts.

In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question, we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.

Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

They encrypt the users' input and protect their privacy. The expert level models focus on merging specific knowledge such as finance, IT and art. The traditional models focus on the universal knowledge discovery and upgrading the expert models. In such classifications, the personal models directly interact with the user. For the whole system, the personal models have users' (encrypted) personal information. Moreover, such models must be small enough to be performed on personal computers or mobile devices.

This is extremely challenging for large language models (LLMs) with vanilla full-parameter tuning due to high computation costs, memory consumption, and forgetting issue. Inspired by the success of parameter-efficient tuning (PET), we propose Continual Parameter-Efficient Tuning (ConPET), a generalizable paradigm for continual task adaptation of LLMs with task-number-independent training complexity. ConPET includes two versions with different application scenarios. First, Static ConPET can adapt former continual learning methods originally designed for relatively smaller models to LLMs through PET and a dynamic replay strategy, which largely reduces the tuning costs and alleviates the over-fitting and forgetting issue. Furthermore, to maintain scalability, Dynamic ConPET adopts separate PET modules for different tasks and a PET module selector for dynamic optimal selection. In our extensive experiments, the adaptation of Static ConPET helps multiple former methods reduce the scale of tunable parameters by over 3,000 times and surpass the PET-only baseline by at least 5 points on five smaller benchmarks, while Dynamic ConPET gains its advantage on the largest dataset.

To unleash the power of LLMs in few-shot learning scenarios, we introduce a novel Knowledgeable In-Context Tuning (KICT) framework to further improve the performance of ICL: 1) injecting factual knowledge to LLMs during continual self-supervised pre-training, 2) judiciously selecting the examples with high knowledge relevance, and 3) calibrating the prediction results based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed approaches on auto-regressive LLMs (e.g., GPT-style models) over multiple text classification and question answering tasks.

Through taking into account the situations of ubiquitous devices, users and the societies, context-aware computing has enabled a wide spectrum of innovative applications, such as assisted living, location-based social network services and so on. To recognize contexts and make decisions for actions accordingly, various artificial intelligence technologies, such as Ontology and OWL, have been adopted as representations for context modeling and reasoning. Recently, with the rise of LLMs and their improved natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, it has become feasible to model contexts using natural language and perform context reasoning by interacting with LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the use of texts, prompts, and autonomous agents (AutoAgents) that enable LLMs to perform context modeling and reasoning without requiring fine-tuning of the model. We organize and introduce works in the related field, and name this computing paradigm as the LLM-driven Context-aware Computing (LCaC). In the LCaC paradigm, users' requests, sensors reading data, and the command to actuators are supposed to be represented as texts. Given the text of users' request and sensor data, the AutoAgent models the context by prompting and sends to the LLM for context reasoning. LLM generates a plan of actions and responds to the AutoAgent, which later follows the action plan to foster context-awareness. To prove the concepts, we use two showcases--(1) operating a mobile z-arm in an apartment for assisted living, and (2) planning a trip and scheduling the itinerary in a context-aware and personalized manner.

  Software Engineering (ASE 2023)",,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in automatic code generation by improving coding efficiency to a certain extent. However, generating high-quality and reliable code remains a formidable task because of LLMs' lack of good programming practice, especially in exception handling. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study and summarise three crucial challenges of LLMs in exception handling, i.e., incomplete exception handling, incorrect exception handling and abuse of try-catch. We then try prompts with different granularities to address such challenges, finding fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts works best. Based on our empirical study, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Prompt Chaining-based code generation approach, name KPC, which decomposes code generation into an AI chain with iterative check-rewrite steps and chains fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts to assist LLMs in considering exception-handling specifications. We evaluate our KPC-based approach with 3,079 code generation tasks extracted from the Java official API documentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the KPC-based approach has considerable potential to ameliorate the quality of code generated by LLMs. It achieves this through proficiently managing exceptions and obtaining remarkable enhancements of 109.86% and 578.57% with static evaluation methods, as well as a reduction of 18 runtime bugs in the sampled dataset with dynamic validation.

It combines the abilities of different models to make up for the biases and errors of a single model to achieve better performance. However, deep model fusion on large-scale deep learning models (e.g., LLMs and foundation models) faces several challenges, including high computational cost, high-dimensional parameter space, interference between different heterogeneous models, etc. Although model fusion has attracted widespread attention due to its potential to solve complex real-world tasks, there is still a lack of complete and detailed survey research on this technique. Accordingly, in order to understand the model fusion method better and promote its development, we present a comprehensive survey to summarize the recent progress. Specifically, we categorize existing deep model fusion methods as four-fold: (1) ""Mode connectivity"", which connects the solutions in weight space via a path of non-increasing loss, in order to obtain better initialization for model fusion; (2) ""Alignment"" matches units between neural networks to create better conditions for fusion; (3) ""Weight average"", a classical model fusion method, averages the weights of multiple models to obtain more accurate results closer to the optimal solution; (4) ""Ensemble learning"" combines the outputs of diverse models, which is a foundational technique for improving the accuracy and robustness of the final model. In addition, we analyze the challenges faced by deep model fusion and propose possible research directions for model fusion in the future. Our review is helpful in deeply understanding the correlation between different model fusion methods and practical application methods, which can enlighten the research in the field of deep model fusion.

Efforts have been made to recover the seen images from brain signals. However, most existing approaches cannot faithfully reflect the visual contents due to insufficient image quality or semantic mismatches. Compared with reconstructing pixel-level visual images, speaking is a more efficient and effective way to explain visual information. Here we introduce a non-invasive neural decoder, termed as MindGPT, which interprets perceived visual stimuli into natural languages from fMRI signals. Specifically, our model builds upon a visually guided neural encoder with a cross-attention mechanism, which permits us to guide latent neural representations towards a desired language semantic direction in an end-to-end manner by the collaborative use of the large language model GPT. By doing so, we found that the neural representations of the MindGPT are explainable, which can be used to evaluate the contributions of visual properties to language semantics. Our experiments show that the generated word sequences truthfully represented the visual information (with essential details) conveyed in the seen stimuli. The results also suggested that with respect to language decoding tasks, the higher visual cortex (HVC) is more semantically informative than the lower visual cortex (LVC), and using only the HVC can recover most of the semantic information. The code of the MindGPT model will be publicly available at https://github.com/JxuanC/MindGPT.

Nevertheless, their full potential, particularly concerning the mitigation of hallucinations and refinement through prover error messages, remains an area that has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in the field, we introduce the Lyra, a new framework that employs two distinct correction mechanisms: Tool Correction (TC) and Conjecture Correction (CC). To implement Tool Correction in the post-processing of formal proofs, we leverage prior knowledge to utilize predefined prover tools (e.g., Sledgehammer) for guiding the replacement of incorrect tools. Tool Correction significantly contributes to mitigating hallucinations, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the proof. In addition, we introduce Conjecture Correction, an error feedback mechanism designed to interact with prover to refine formal proof conjectures with prover error messages. Compared to the previous refinement framework, the proposed Conjecture Correction refines generation with instruction but does not collect paired (generation, error & refinement) prompts. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both miniF2F validation (48.0% -> 55.3%) and test (45.5% -> 51.2%). We also present 3 IMO problems solved by Lyra. We believe Tool Correction (post-process for hallucination mitigation) and Conjecture Correction (subgoal adjustment from interaction with environment) could provide a promising avenue for future research in this field.

The latest query clarification method is knowledge graph (KG)-based, but limitations include out-of-vocabulary (OOV) failures and rigid question templates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge-guided query clarification approach for API recommendation that leverages a large language model (LLM) guided by KG. We utilize the LLM as a neural knowledge base to overcome OOV failures, generating fluent and appropriate clarification questions and options. We also leverage the structured API knowledge and entity relationships stored in the KG to filter out noise, and transfer the optimal clarification path from KG to the LLM, increasing the efficiency of the clarification process. Our approach is designed as an AI chain that consists of five steps, each handled by a separate LLM call, to improve accuracy, efficiency, and fluency for query clarification in API recommendation. We verify the usefulness of each unit in our AI chain, which all received high scores close to a perfect 5. When compared to the baselines, our approach shows a significant improvement in MRR, with a maximum increase of 63.9% higher when the query statement is covered in KG and 37.2% when it is not. Ablation experiments reveal that the guidance of knowledge in the KG and the knowledge-guided pathfinding strategy are crucial for our approach's performance, resulting in a 19.0% and 22.2% increase in MAP, respectively. Our approach demonstrates a way to bridge the gap between KG and LLM, effectively compensating for the strengths and weaknesses of both.

To address this problem, counterfactual explanations (CEs) have been proposed. CEs are unique as they provide workable suggestions to users, in addition to explaining why a certain outcome was predicted. However, the application of CEs has been hindered by two main challenges, namely general user preferences and variable ML systems. User preferences, in particular, tend to be general rather than specific feature values. Additionally, CEs need to be customized to suit the variability of ML models, while also maintaining robustness even when these validation models change. To overcome these challenges, we propose several possible general user preferences that have been validated by user research and map them to the properties of CEs. We also introduce a new method called \uline{T}ree-based \uline{C}onditions \uline{O}ptional \uline{L}inks (T-COL), which has two optional structures and several groups of conditions for generating CEs that can be adapted to general user preferences. Meanwhile, a group of conditions lead T-COL to generate more robust CEs that have higher validity when the ML model is replaced. We compared the properties of CEs generated by T-COL experimentally under different user preferences and demonstrated that T-COL is better suited for accommodating user preferences and variable ML systems compared to baseline methods including Large Language Models.

Unfortunately, in the real-world, datasets may contain dirty samples, such as poisoned samples from backdoor attack, noisy labels in crowdsourcing, and even hybrids of them. The presence of such dirty samples makes the DNNs vunerable and unreliable.Hence, it is critical to detect dirty samples to improve the quality and realiability of dataset. Existing detectors only focus on detecting poisoned samples or noisy labels, that are often prone to weak generalization when dealing with dirty samples from other domains.In this paper, we find a commonality of various dirty samples is visual-linguistic inconsistency between images and associated labels. To capture the semantic inconsistency between modalities, we propose versatile data cleanser (VDC) leveraging the surpassing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLM) in cross-modal alignment and reasoning.It consists of three consecutive modules: the visual question generation module to generate insightful questions about the image; the visual question answering module to acquire the semantics of the visual content by answering the questions with MLLM; followed by the visual answer evaluation module to evaluate the inconsistency.Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance and generalization to various categories and types of dirty samples.

However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical legal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether they can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously crafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three cognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize needed legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding: whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal text; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their legal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal tasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label classification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction and generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench, including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal domain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs on legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way from obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model predictions and evaluation code are released in https://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark provides in-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed up the development of LLMs in the legal domain.

Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove DiLu's capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advantage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to instill knowledge-driven capability into autonomous driving systems from the perspective of how humans drive.

Inspired by the great success of code data in training LLMs, we naturally wonder at which training stage introducing code data can really help LLMs reasoning. To this end, this paper systematically explores the impact of code data on LLMs at different stages. Concretely, we introduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both of them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively and fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks in five domains. We critically analyze the experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training LLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the instruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capability. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to learn reasoning capability step-by-step during training. These insights deepen the understanding of LLMs regarding reasoning ability for their application, such as scientific question answering, legal support, etc. The source code and model parameters are released at the link:~\url{https://github.com/yingweima2022/CodeLLM}.

Despite the wide range of prior research, existing persuasive techniques are not flexible enough to provide dynamic persuasion content based on users' physical contexts and mental states. We first conduct a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=12) and an interview study (N=10) to summarize the mental states behind problematic smartphone use: boredom, stress, and inertia. This informs our design of four persuasion strategies: understanding, comforting, evoking, and scaffolding habits. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to enable the automatic and dynamic generation of effective persuasion content. We develop MindShift, a novel LLM-powered problematic smartphone use intervention technique. MindShift takes users' in-the-moment physical contexts, mental states, app usage behaviors, users' goals & habits as input, and generates high-quality and flexible persuasive content with appropriate persuasion strategies. We conduct a 5-week field experiment (N=25) to compare MindShift with baseline techniques. The results show that MindShift significantly improves intervention acceptance rates by 17.8-22.5% and reduces smartphone use frequency by 12.1-14.4%. Moreover, users have a significant drop in smartphone addiction scale scores and a rise in self-efficacy. Our study sheds light on the potential of leveraging LLMs for context-aware persuasion in other behavior change domains.

By introducing translation from STM into the triplet in-context demonstrations, SCALE unlocks refinement and pivoting ability of LLM, thus mitigating language bias of LLM and parallel data bias of STM, enhancing LLM speciality without sacrificing generality, and facilitating continual learning without expensive LLM fine-tuning. Our comprehensive experiments show that SCALE significantly outperforms both few-shot LLMs (GPT-4) and specialized models (NLLB) in challenging low-resource settings. Moreover, in Xhosa to English translation, SCALE experiences consistent improvement by a 4 BLEURT score without tuning LLM and surpasses few-shot GPT-4 by 2.5 COMET score and 3.8 BLEURT score when equipped with a compact model consisting of merely 600M parameters. SCALE could also effectively exploit the existing language bias of LLMs by using an English-centric STM as a pivot for translation between any language pairs, outperforming few-shot GPT-4 by an average of 6 COMET points across eight translation directions. Furthermore we provide an in-depth analysis of SCALE's robustness, translation characteristics, and latency costs, providing solid foundation for future studies exploring the potential synergy between LLMs and more specialized, task-specific models.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, some of which are important for IR. Nonetheless, LLMs frequently confront the issue of generating responses that lack specificity. This has limited the overall effectiveness of LLMs for IR in many cases. To address these issues, we present an unsupervised alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from Contrastive Feedback (RLCF), which empowers LLMs to generate both high-quality and context-specific responses that suit the needs of IR tasks. Specifically, we construct contrastive feedback by comparing each document with its similar documents, and then propose a reward function named Batched-MRR to teach LLMs to generate responses that captures the fine-grained information that distinguish documents from their similar ones. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF, we conducted experiments in two typical applications of LLMs in IR, i.e., data augmentation and summarization. The experimental results show that RLCF can effectively improve the performance of LLMs in IR context.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can potentially provide valuable guidance to agents in learning policies, thereby enhancing the performance of RL algorithms in such environments. However, LLMs often encounter difficulties in understanding downstream tasks, which hinders their ability to optimally assist agents in these tasks. A common approach to mitigating this issue is to fine-tune the LLMs with task-related data, enabling them to offer useful guidance for RL agents. However, this approach encounters several difficulties, such as inaccessible model weights or the need for significant computational resources, making it impractical. In this work, we introduce RLAdapter, a framework that builds a better connection between RL algorithms and LLMs by incorporating an adapter model. Within the RLAdapter framework, fine-tuning a lightweight language model with information generated during the training process of RL agents significantly aids LLMs in adapting to downstream tasks, thereby providing better guidance for RL agents. We conducted experiments to evaluate RLAdapter in the Crafter environment, and the results show that RLAdapter surpasses the SOTA baselines. Furthermore, agents under our framework exhibit common-sense behaviors that are absent in baseline models.

Recent work like Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Reasoning via Planning (RAP) aim to augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by utilizing tree-search algorithms to guide multi-step reasoning. These methods mainly focus on LLMs' reasoning ability during inference and heavily rely on human-designed prompts to activate LLM as a value function, which lacks general applicability and scalability. To address these limitations, we present an AlphaZero-like tree-search framework for LLMs (termed TS-LLM), systematically illustrating how tree-search with a learned value function can guide LLMs' decoding ability. TS-LLM distinguishes itself in two key ways: (1) Leveraging a learned value function, our approach can be generally applied to different tasks beyond reasoning (such as RLHF alignment), and LLMs of any size, without prompting advanced, large-scale models. (2) It can guide LLM's decoding during both inference and training. Empirical evaluations across reasoning, planning, and RLHF alignment tasks validate the effectiveness of TS-LLM, even on trees with a depth of 64.

2309.17272,Shuai Lu,"Baizhou Huang, Shuai Lu, Weizhu Chen, Xiaojun Wan, Nan Duan",Enhancing Large Language Models in Coding Through Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency,Preprint version,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in textual generation. However, in complex reasoning tasks such as code generation, generating the correct answer in a single attempt remains a formidable challenge for LLMs. Previous research has explored solutions by aggregating multiple outputs, leveraging the consistency among them. However, none of them have comprehensively captured this consistency from different perspectives. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework, a novel decoding strategy for LLM that incorporates both inter-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives and intra-consistency within a single perspective. Specifically, we ask LLMs to sample multiple diverse outputs from various perspectives for a given query and then construct a multipartite graph based on them. With two predefined measures of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice is then determined based on consistency analysis in the graph. We conduct comprehensive evaluation on the code generation task by introducing solution, specification and test case as three perspectives. We leverage a code interpreter to quantitatively measure the inter-consistency and propose several intra-consistency measure functions. Our MPSC framework significantly boosts the performance on various popular benchmarks, including HumanEval (+17.60%), HumanEval Plus (+17.61%), MBPP (+6.50%) and CodeContests (+11.82%) in Pass@1, when compared to original outputs generated from ChatGPT, and even surpassing GPT-4.

  Karlsson, Jie Fu, Yemin Shi",AutoAgents: A Framework for Automatic Agent Generation,,,,,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

  Zhaoran Wang","Reason for Future, Act for Now: A Principled Framework for Autonomous LLM Agents with Provable Sample Efficiency",,,,,cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In particular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call ``reason for future, act for now"" (\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon (``reason for future""). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (``act for now""), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.   The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory buffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an ""in-context"" manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of long-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret. In particular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the prior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction achieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it outperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a few benchmarks.

To this end, we establish a quantitative benchmarking framework and conduct the role playing intervention to control LLMs' preference. In specific, we define two types of robustness, factual robustness targeting the ability to identify the correct fact from prompts or memory, and decision style to categorize LLMs' behavior in making consistent choices -- assuming there is no definitive ""right"" answer -- intuitive, dependent, or rational based on cognitive theory. Our findings, derived from extensive experiments on seven open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that these models are highly susceptible to misleading prompts, especially for instructing commonsense knowledge. While detailed instructions can mitigate the selection of misleading answers, they also increase the incidence of invalid responses. After Unraveling the preference, we intervene different sized LLMs through specific style of role instruction, showing their varying upper bound of robustness and adaptivity.

In this paper, we propose ToRA a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to solve challenging mathematical problems by seamlessly integrating natural language reasoning with the utilization of external tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers), thereby amalgamating the analytical prowess of language and the computational efficiency of tools. To train ToRA, we curate interactive tool-use trajectories on mathematical datasets, apply imitation learning on the annotations, and propose output space shaping to further refine models' reasoning behavior. As a result, ToRA models significantly outperform open-source models on 10 mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with 13%-19% absolute improvements on average. Notably, ToRA-7B reaches 44.6% on the competition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model WizardMath-70B by 22% absolute. ToRA-Code-34B is also the first open-source model that achieves an accuracy exceeding 50% on MATH, which significantly outperforms GPT-4's CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems with programs.

Established reference-based evaluation metrics rely on human-annotated reasoning chains to assess the model-derived chains.

Existing reference-free reasoning metrics eliminate the need for human-crafted reasoning chains as references, but they typically require fine-tuning on datasets with human-derived reasoning chains, which complicates the process and raises concerns regarding generalizability across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we harness GPT-4 to automatically evaluate reasoning chain quality, obviating the need for human-crafted references. Leveraging the Socratic method, we devise tailored prompts to enhance reference-free reasoning evaluation, which we term SocREval (Socratic method for Reasoning Evaluation).

Red-teaming techniques constitute a critical way towards this criterion. Existing work rely solely on manual red team designs and heuristic adversarial prompts for vulnerability detection and optimization. These approaches lack rigorous mathematical formulation, thus limiting the exploration of diverse attack strategy within quantifiable measure and optimization of LLMs under convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present Red-teaming Game (RTG), a general game-theoretic framework without manual annotation. RTG is designed for analyzing the multi-turn attack and defense interactions between Red-team language Models (RLMs) and Blue-team Language Model (BLM). Within the RTG, we propose Gamified Red-teaming Solver (GRTS) with diversity measure of the semantic space. GRTS is an automated red teaming technique to solve RTG towards Nash equilibrium through meta-game analysis, which corresponds to the theoretically guaranteed optimization direction of both RLMs and BLM. Empirical results in multi-turn attacks with RLMs show that GRTS autonomously discovered diverse attack strategies and effectively improved security of LLMs, outperforming existing heuristic red-team designs. Overall, RTG has established a foundational framework for red teaming tasks and constructed a new scalable oversight technique for alignment.

To this end, we present the Value Understanding Measurement (VUM) framework that quantitatively assess both ""know what"" and ""know why"" by measuring the discriminator-critique gap related to human values. Using the Schwartz Value Survey, we specify our evaluation values and develop a thousand-level dialogue dataset with GPT-4. Our assessment looks at both the value alignment of LLM's outputs compared to baseline answers and how LLM responses align with reasons for value recognition versus GPT-4's annotations. We evaluate five representative LLMs and provide strong evidence that the scaling law significantly impacts ""know what"" but not much on ""know why"", which has consistently maintained a high level. This may further suggest that LLMs might craft plausible explanations based on the provided context without truly understanding their inherent value, indicating potential risks.

Previous studies have revealed that ICL is sensitive to the selection and the ordering of demonstrations. However, there are few studies regarding the impact of the demonstration number on the ICL performance within a limited input length of LLM, because it is commonly believed that the number of demonstrations is positively correlated with model performance. In this paper, we found this conclusion does not always hold true. Through pilot experiments, we discover that increasing the number of demonstrations does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a Dynamic Demonstrations Controller (D$^2$Controller), which can improve the ICL performance by adjusting the number of demonstrations dynamically. The experimental results show that D$^2$Controller yields a 5.4% relative improvement on eight different sizes of LLMs across ten datasets. Moreover, we also extend our method to previous ICL models and achieve competitive results.

  Beschastnikh",Empirical Study on Transformer-based Techniques for Software Engineering,,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Many Transformer-based pre-trained models for code have been developed and applied to code-related tasks. In this paper, we review the existing literature, examine the suitability of model architectures for different tasks, and look at the generalization ability of models on different datasets, and their resource consumption.   We examine three very representative pre-trained models for code: CodeBERT, CodeGPT, and CodeT5, and conduct experiments on the top-4 most targeted software engineering tasks that we found in our literature survey: Code Summarization, Bug Fixing, Bug Detection, and Code Search. In our study, we showcase the capability of decoder-only models (CodeGPT) for specific generation tasks under state-of-the-art evaluation metrics and contest the common belief that the encoder-decoder architecture is optimal for general-purpose coding tasks. Additionally, we found that the most frequently used models are not necessarily the most suitable for certain applications and the developers' needs are not adequately addressed by current research. As well, we found that the benchmark and frequent dataset for Bug Fixing and Code Summarization both fail to enable models to generalize onto other datasets for the same task (the frequent dataset refers to the dataset with the highest frequency used in literature other than the benchmark). We use statistical testing to support our conclusions from experiments. Finally, CodeBERT is highly efficient for understanding tasks, whereas CodeT5's efficiency for generation tasks is in doubt, as the highest resource consumption does not guarantee a consistent better performance on different metrics. We also discuss the numerous practical issues in advancing future research on transformer-based models for code-related tasks.

Instruction fine-tuning is critical in enabling LLMs to align with user intentions and effectively follow instructions. In this work, we investigate how instruction fine-tuning modifies pre-trained models, focusing on two perspectives: instruction recognition and knowledge evolution. To study the behavior shift of LLMs, we employ a suite of local and global explanation methods, including a gradient-based approach for input-output attribution and techniques for interpreting patterns and concepts in self-attention and feed-forward layers. Our findings reveal three significant impacts of instruction fine-tuning: 1) It empowers LLMs to better recognize the instruction parts from user prompts, thereby facilitating high-quality response generation and addressing the ``lost-in-the-middle'' issue observed in pre-trained models; 2) It aligns the knowledge stored in feed-forward layers with user-oriented tasks, exhibiting minimal shifts across linguistic levels. 3) It facilitates the learning of word-word relations with instruction verbs through the self-attention mechanism, particularly in the lower and middle layers, indicating enhanced recognition of instruction words. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior shifts in LLMs after instruction fine-tuning and lay the groundwork for future research aimed at interpreting and optimizing LLMs for various applications. We will release our code and data soon.

  Shuai Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Yang Liu",Split and Merge: Aligning Position Biases in Large Language Model based Evaluators,,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as automated evaluators for assessing the quality of answers generated by AI systems. However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.

  Bu",Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4,,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in automatically designing graph neural networks. However, GNAS still requires intensive human labor with rich domain knowledge to design the search space and search strategy. In this paper, we integrate GPT-4 into GNAS and propose a new GPT-4 based Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GPT4GNAS for short). The basic idea of our method is to design a new class of prompts for GPT-4 to guide GPT-4 toward the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running GPT-4 with the prompts, GPT4GNAS generates more accurate graph neural networks with fast convergence. Experimental results show that embedding GPT-4 into GNAS outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods.
