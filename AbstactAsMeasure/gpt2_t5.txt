 'KEPR: Knowledge Enhancement and Plausibility Ranking for Generative Commonsense Question Answering'
 '  Generative commonsense question answering (GenCQA) is a task of automatically generating a list of answers given a question. The answer list is required to cover all reasonable answers. This presents the considerable challenges of producing diverse answers and ranking them properly. Incorporating a variety of closely-related background knowledge into the encoding of questions enables the generation of different answers. Meanwhile, learning to distinguish positive answers from negative ones potentially enhances the probabilistic estimation of plausibility, and accordingly, the plausibility-based ranking. Therefore, we propose a Knowledge Enhancement and Plausibility Ranking (KEPR) approach grounded on the Generate-Then-Rank pipeline architecture. Specifically, we expand questions in terms of Wiktionary commonsense knowledge of keywords, and reformulate them with normalized patterns. Dense passage retrieval is utilized for capturing relevant knowledge, and different PLM-based (BART, GPT2 and T5) networks are used for generating answers. On the other hand, we develop an ELECTRA-based answer ranking model, where logistic regression is conducted during training, with the aim of approximating different levels of plausibility in a polar classification scenario. Extensive experiments on the benchmark ProtoQA show that KEPR obtains substantial improvements, compared to the strong baselines. Within the experimental models, the T5-based GenCQA with KEPR obtains the best performance, which is up to 60.91% at the primary canonical metric Inc@3. It outperforms the existing GenCQA models on the current leaderboard of ProtoQA. ']

 'Evaluation of Transfer Learning for Polish with a Text-to-Text Model'
 '  We introduce a new benchmark for assessing the quality of text-to-text models for Polish. The benchmark consists of diverse tasks and datasets: KLEJ benchmark adapted for text-to-text, en-pl translation, summarization, and question answering. In particular, since summarization and question answering lack benchmark datasets for the Polish language, we describe their construction and make them publicly available. Additionally, we present plT5 - a general-purpose text-to-text model for Polish that can be fine-tuned on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with a single training objective. Unsupervised denoising pre-training is performed efficiently by initializing the model weights with a multi-lingual T5 (mT5) counterpart. We evaluate the performance of plT5, mT5, Polish BART (plBART), and Polish GPT-2 (papuGaPT2). The plT5 scores top on all of these tasks except summarization, where plBART is best. In general (except for summarization), the larger the model, the better the results. The encoder-decoder architectures prove to be better than the decoder-only equivalent. ']

 '  Transformer-based models have made tremendous impacts in natural language generation. However the inference speed is a bottleneck due to large model size and intensive computing involved in auto-regressive decoding process. We develop FastSeq framework to accelerate sequence generation without accuracy loss. The proposed optimization techniques include an attention cache optimization, an efficient algorithm for detecting repeated n-grams, and an asynchronous generation pipeline with parallel I/O. These optimizations are general enough to be applicable to Transformer-based models (e.g., T5, GPT2, and UniLM). Our benchmark results on a set of widely used and diverse models demonstrate 4-9x inference speed gain. Additionally, FastSeq is easy to use with a simple one-line code change.

 '  Transformer-based pretrained models like BERT, GPT-2 and T5 have been finetuned for a large number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and have been shown to be very effective. However, while finetuning, what changes across layers in these models with respect to pretrained checkpoints is under-studied. Further, how robust are these models to perturbations in input text? Does the robustness vary depending on the NLP task for which the models have been finetuned? While there exists some work on studying robustness of BERT finetuned for a few NLP tasks, there is no rigorous study which compares this robustness across encoder only, decoder only and encoder-decoder models.   In this paper, we study the robustness of three language models (BERT, GPT-2 and T5) with eight different text perturbations on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. Also, we use two metrics (CKA and STIR) to quantify changes between pretrained and finetuned language model representations across layers. GPT-2 representations are more robust than BERT and T5 across multiple types of input perturbation. Although models exhibit good robustness broadly, dropping nouns, verbs or changing characters are the most impactful. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into perturbation-specific weaknesses of popular Transformer-based models which should be kept in mind when passing inputs. ']

 'Does Deep Learning Learn to Abstract? A Systematic Probing Framework'
 '  Abstraction is a desirable capability for deep learning models, which means to induce abstract concepts from concrete instances and flexibly apply them beyond the learning context. At the same time, there is a lack of clear understanding about both the presence and further characteristics of this capability in deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce a systematic probing framework to explore the abstraction capability of deep learning models from a transferability perspective. A set of controlled experiments are conducted based on this framework, providing strong evidence that two probed pre-trained language models (PLMs), T5 and GPT2, have the abstraction capability. We also conduct in-depth analysis, thus shedding further light: (1) the whole training phase exhibits a "memorize-then-abstract" two-stage process; (2) the learned abstract concepts are gathered in a few middle-layer attention heads, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the model; (3) the probed abstraction capabilities exhibit robustness against concept mutations, and are more robust to low-level/source-side mutations than high-level/target-side ones; (4) generic pre-training is critical to the emergence of abstraction capability, and PLMs exhibit better abstraction with larger model sizes and data scales.

 'Low Frequency Names Exhibit Bias and Overfitting in Contextualizing Language Models'
 "  We use a dataset of U.S. first names with labels based on predominant gender and racial group to examine the effect of training corpus frequency on tokenization, contextualization, similarity to initial representation, and bias in BERT, GPT-2, T5, and XLNet. We show that predominantly female and non-white names are less frequent in the training corpora of these four language models. We find that infrequent names are more self-similar across contexts, with Spearman's r between frequency and self-similarity as low as -.763. Infrequent names are also less similar to initial representation, with Spearman's r between frequency and linear centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity to initial representation as high as .702. Moreover, we find Spearman's r between racial bias and name frequency in BERT of .492, indicating that lower-frequency minority group names are more associated with unpleasantness. Representations of infrequent names undergo more processing, but are more self-similar, indicating that models rely on less context-informed representations of uncommon and minority names which are overfit to a lower number of observed contexts.

 'Parameter-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Pre-trained Language Models'
 '  Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (short as MoE) architecture has achieved remarkable success in increasing the model capacity of large-scale language models. However, MoE requires incorporating significantly more parameters than the base model being extended. In this paper, we propose building a parameter-efficient MoE architecture by sharing information among experts. We adopt the matrix product operator (MPO, a tensor decomposition from quantum many-body physics) to reconstruct the parameter matrix in the expert layer and increase model capacity for pre-trained language models by sharing parameters of the central tensor (containing the core information) among different experts while enabling the specificity through the auxiliary tensors (complementing the central tensor) of different experts. To address the unbalanced optimization issue, we further design the gradient mask strategy for the MPO-based MoE architecture. Extensive experiments based on T5 and GPT-2 show improved performance and efficiency of the pre-trained language model (27.2x reduction in total parameters for the superior model performance, compared with the Switch Transformers). Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/MPOE. ']



['2021-09-15' 'Topic Transferable Table Question Answering'
 "  Weakly-supervised table question-answering(TableQA) models have achieved state-of-art performance by using pre-trained BERT transformer to jointly encoding a question and a table to produce structured query for the question. However, in practical settings TableQA systems are deployed over table corpora having topic and word distributions quite distinct from BERT's pretraining corpus. In this work we simulate the practical topic shift scenario by designing novel challenge benchmarks WikiSQL-TS and WikiTQ-TS, consisting of train-dev-test splits in five distinct topic groups, based on the popular WikiSQL and WikiTableQuestions datasets. We empirically show that, despite pre-training on large open-domain text, performance of models degrades significantly when they are evaluated on unseen topics. In response, we propose T3QA (Topic Transferable Table Question Answering) a pragmatic adaptation framework for TableQA comprising of: (1) topic-specific vocabulary injection into BERT, (2) a novel text-to-text transformer generator (such as T5, GPT2) based natural language question generation pipeline focused on generating topic specific training data, and (3) a logical form reranker. We show that T3QA provides a reasonably good baseline for our topic shift benchmarks. We believe our topic split benchmarks will lead to robust TableQA solutions that are better suited for practical deployment. "]

 'Building Markovian Generative Architectures over Pretrained LM Backbones for Efficient Task-Oriented Dialog Systems'
 '  Recently, Transformer based pretrained language models (PLMs), such as GPT2 and T5, have been leveraged to build generative task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. A drawback of existing PLM-based models is their non-Markov architectures across turns, i.e., the whole history is used as the conditioning input at each turn. First, this brings inefficiencies in memory and computation. Furthermore, using the whole history increases model complexity and may hurt the training efficiency, especially when facing small amounts of labeled training data (the low-resource setting). In this paper, motivated by the observation that dialog states could be viewed as Markov states, we propose to build Markovian Generative Architectures (MGA) over PLM backbones for efficient TOD systems. Experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 show that in the rich-resource setting, the proposed Markov models reduce memory and time costs without performance degradation; in the low-resource setting, the training efficiency of the Markov models is more significant.

 'Transformer-based Program Synthesis for Low-Data Environments'
 "  Recent advancements in large pre-trained transformer models (GPT2/3, T5) have found use in program synthesis to generate programs that satisfy a set of input/output examples. However, these models perform poorly on long-horizon and low-data tasks, and often don't seem to understand the semantics of the languages they generate. We investigate an approach that tackles both of these issues, by using attributed context-free-grammars of programming languages to generate programs, and then analyzing generated programs so that they can be annotated with compile and runtime attributes, such as types, so that information about the program can be remembered during long-horizon generation. We firstly find that synthesized datasets can be made efficiently and can provide transformer models with enough data in order to perform well on some synthesis tasks. We also find that giving models access to program attributes is especially effective in low-data environments, and tends improve the quality and reduce errors of transformer-generated programs.

 'Investigating Pre-trained Language Models on Cross-Domain Datasets, a Step Closer to General AI'
 '  Pre-trained language models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for fine-tuning a variety of language tasks. Ideally, when models are pre-trained on large amount of data, they are expected to gain implicit knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the ability of pre-trained language models to generalize to different non-language tasks. In particular, we test them on tasks from different domains such as computer vision, reasoning on hierarchical data, and protein fold prediction. The four pre-trained models that we used, T5, BART, BERT, and GPT-2 achieve outstanding results. They all have similar performance and they outperform transformers that are trained from scratch by a large margin. For instance, pre-trained language models perform better on the Listops dataset, with an average accuracy of 58.7\\%, compared to transformers trained from scratch, which have an average accuracy of 29.0\\%. The significant improvement demonstrated across three types of datasets suggests that pre-training on language helps the models to acquire general knowledge, bringing us a step closer to general AI. We also showed that reducing the number of parameters in pre-trained language models does not have a great impact as the performance drops slightly when using T5-Small instead of T5-Base. In fact, when using only 2\\% of the parameters, we achieved a great improvement compared to training from scratch. Finally, in contrast to prior work, we find out that using pre-trained embeddings for the input layer is necessary to achieve the desired results. ']

 'How Can We Know When Language Models Know? On the Calibration of Language Models for Question Answering'
 '  Recent works have shown that language models (LM) capture different types of knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this paper, we ask the question "how can we know when language models know, with confidence, the answer to a particular query?" We examine this question from the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model\'s predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities of correctness. We examine three strong generative models -- T5, BART, and GPT-2 -- and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated, finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods, shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for calibrating LMs. We have released the code at https://github.com/jzbjyb/lm-calibration.

 'Towards Zero-Shot Functional Compositionality of Language Models'
 "  Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) have become the most desirable starting point in the field of NLP, as they have become remarkably good at solving many individual tasks. Despite such success, in this paper, we argue that current paradigms of working with PLMs are neglecting a critical aspect of modeling human intelligence: functional compositionality. Functional compositionality - the ability to compose learned tasks - has been a long-standing challenge in the field of AI (and many other fields) as it is considered one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. An illustrative example of such is cross-lingual summarization, where a bilingual person (English-French) could directly summarize an English document into French sentences without having to translate the English document or summary into French explicitly. We discuss why this matter is an important open problem that requires further attention from the field. Then, we show that current PLMs (e.g., GPT-2 and T5) don't have functional compositionality yet and it is far from human-level generalizability. Finally, we suggest several research directions that could push the field towards zero-shot functional compositionality of language models. "]

 'Bias at a Second Glance: A Deep Dive into Bias for German Educational Peer-Review Data Modeling'
 '  Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly utilized to provide adaptivity in educational applications. However, recent research has highlighted a variety of biases in pre-trained language models. While existing studies investigate bias in different domains, they are limited in addressing fine-grained analysis on educational and multilingual corpora. In this work, we analyze bias across text and through multiple architectures on a corpus of 9,165 German peer-reviews collected from university students over five years. Notably, our corpus includes labels such as helpfulness, quality, and critical aspect ratings from the peer-review recipient as well as demographic attributes. We conduct a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) analysis on (1) our collected corpus in connection with the clustered labels, (2) the most common pre-trained German language models (T5, BERT, and GPT-2) and GloVe embeddings, and (3) the language models after fine-tuning on our collected data-set. In contrast to our initial expectations, we found that our collected corpus does not reveal many biases in the co-occurrence analysis or in the GloVe embeddings. However, the pre-trained German language models find substantial conceptual, racial, and gender bias and have significant changes in bias across conceptual and racial axes during fine-tuning on the peer-review data. With our research, we aim to contribute to the fourth UN sustainability goal (quality education) with a novel dataset, an understanding of biases in natural language education data, and the potential harms of not counteracting biases in language models for educational tasks.

 'Revisiting the Architectures like Pointer Networks to Efficiently Improve the Next Word Distribution, Summarization Factuality, and Beyond'
 '  Is the output softmax layer, which is adopted by most language models (LMs), always the best way to compute the next word probability? Given so many attention layers in a modern transformer-based LM, are the pointer networks redundant nowadays? In this study, we discover that the answers to both questions are no. This is because the softmax bottleneck sometimes prevents the LMs from predicting the desired distribution and the pointer networks can be used to break the bottleneck efficiently. Based on the finding, we propose several softmax alternatives by simplifying the pointer networks and accelerating the word-by-word rerankers. In GPT-2, our proposals are significantly better and more efficient than mixture of softmax, a state-of-the-art softmax alternative. In summarization experiments, without significantly decreasing its training/testing speed, our best method based on T5-Small improves factCC score by 2 points in CNN/DM and XSUM dataset, and improves MAUVE scores by 30% in BookSum paragraph-level dataset.

 '  We examine whether large neural language models, trained on very large collections of varied English text, learn the potentially long-distance dependency of British versus American spelling conventions, i.e., whether spelling is consistently one or the other within model-generated strings. In contrast to long-distance dependencies in non-surface underlying structure (e.g., syntax), spelling consistency is easier to measure both in LMs and the text corpora used to train them, which can provide additional insight into certain observed model behaviors. Using a set of probe words unique to either British or American English, we first establish that training corpora exhibit substantial (though not total) consistency. A large T5 language model does appear to internalize this consistency, though only with respect to observed lexical items (not nonce words with British/American spelling patterns). We further experiment with correcting for biases in the training data by fine-tuning T5 on synthetic data that has been debiased, and find that finetuned T5 remains only somewhat sensitive to spelling consistency. Further experiments show GPT2 to be similarly limited. ']

Our methodology achieves an average BLEU score of 0.88 (on a scale of 0-1) and a disinfo-debunk score of 85% on edited claims.

By extending the LIAR PLUS dataset, we achieve an F1 score of 82% for the half-truth detection model, setting a new benchmark in the field.
